1
02:34:56,221 --> 02:34:57,871
What is this place?

2
02:34:58,101 --> 02:34:59,541
It was once the city of Dale.

3
02:35:01,381 --> 02:35:03,065
Now it is a ruin.

4
02:35:03,821 --> 02:35:06,028
The desolation of Smaug.

5
02:35:06,261 --> 02:35:08,184
The sun will soon reach midday.

6
02:35:08,421 --> 02:35:10,916
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

7
02:35:10,941 --> 02:35:11,783
This way.

8
02:35:12,021 --> 02:35:14,069
Wait. Is this the overlook?

9
02:35:14,381 --> 02:35:15,746
Gandalf said to meet him here.

10
02:35:15,981 --> 02:35:17,822
- On no account were we to...
- Do you see him?

11
02:35:18,261 --> 02:35:18,981
We have no time...

12
02:35:19,181 --> 02:35:20,592
to wait upon the Wizard.

13
02:35:20,861 --> 02:35:22,625
We're on our own. Come!
