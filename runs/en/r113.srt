1
03:20:21,078 --> 03:20:23,538
...why should I honor such terms?

2
03:20:25,709 --> 03:20:27,667
Because you gave us your word.

3
03:20:31,923 --> 03:20:34,091
Does that mean nothing?

4
03:20:48,647 --> 03:20:49,814
Be gone!

5
03:20:50,691 --> 03:20:51,691
Ere our arrows...

6
03:20:51,817 --> 03:20:52,942
...fly!

7
03:21:10,962 --> 03:21:12,254
What are you doing?

8
03:21:13,798 --> 03:21:16,466
You cannot go to war.

9
03:21:17,636 --> 03:21:19,928
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...

10
03:21:20,180 --> 03:21:23,640
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.

11
03:21:23,892 --> 03:21:26,685
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

12
03:21:27,562 --> 03:21:29,020
We are, in fact, outnumbered.

13
03:21:31,691 --> 03:21:32,899
Not for much longer.

14
03:21:34,694 --> 03:21:35,694
What does that mean?

15
03:21:35,946 --> 03:21:37,696
It means, Master Baggins...

16
03:21:40,741 --> 03:21:43,077
...you should never underestimate Dwarves.

17
03:21:46,790 --> 03:21:48,582
We have reclaimed Erebor.

18
03:21:49,834 --> 03:21:51,084
Now...

19
03:21:51,336 --> 03:21:52,919
...we defend it.

20
03:22:10,772 --> 03:22:12,606
He will give us nothing.

21
03:22:14,024 --> 03:22:15,234
Such a pity.

22
03:22:15,484 --> 03:22:16,109
Still...

23
03:22:16,361 --> 03:22:18,861
- ...you tried.
- I do not understand.

24
03:22:20,073 --> 03:22:21,156
Why?

25
03:22:21,908 --> 03:22:23,408
Why would he risk war?

26
03:22:36,839 --> 03:22:39,133
It is fruitless to reason with them.

27
03:22:39,383 --> 03:22:40,383
They understand...

28
03:22:40,634 --> 03:22:41,968
...only one thing.

29
03:22:45,932 --> 03:22:47,140
We attack at dawn.

30
03:22:50,352 --> 03:22:51,854
Are you with us?

31
03:23:23,636 --> 03:23:24,636
Aye.

32
03:23:28,515 --> 03:23:30,933
Master Baggins, come here.

33
03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:49,870
You're going to need this.

34
03:23:51,372 --> 03:23:52,622
Put it on.

35
03:23:57,629 --> 03:24:00,381
This vest is made of silver steel.

36
03:24:02,883 --> 03:24:04,258
Mithril...

37
03:24:04,511 --> 03:24:06,678
...it was called by my forebears.

38
03:24:09,808 --> 03:24:11,892
No blade can pierce it.

39
03:24:23,196 --> 03:24:24,196
I look absurd.

40
03:24:24,446 --> 03:24:26,448
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

41
03:24:26,698 --> 03:24:28,158
It is a gift.

42
03:24:29,702 --> 03:24:31,245
A token of our friendship.

43
03:24:34,624 --> 03:24:36,999
True friends are hard to come by.

44
03:24:38,669 --> 03:24:40,337
I have been blind...

45
03:24:40,587 --> 03:24:42,464
...but now I begin to see.

46
03:24:43,841 --> 03:24:45,341
I am betrayed.

47
03:24:46,678 --> 03:24:48,053
Betrayed?

48
03:24:48,595 --> 03:24:50,430
The Arkenstone.

49
03:24:59,899 --> 03:25:01,399
One of them has taken it.

50
03:25:08,658 --> 03:25:11,535
One of them is false.

51
03:25:12,578 --> 03:25:13,745
Thorin...

52
03:25:14,580 --> 03:25:17,749
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain.

53
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:19,209
Is that not enough?

54
03:25:19,461 --> 03:25:21,962
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...

55
03:25:22,629 --> 03:25:26,299
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.

56
03:25:26,551 --> 03:25:27,801
Now, is this treasure...

57
03:25:28,051 --> 03:25:30,553
...truly worth more than your honor?

58
03:25:30,805 --> 03:25:33,223
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.

59
03:25:33,892 --> 03:25:35,725
For that, I am grateful.

60
03:25:35,977 --> 03:25:37,810
It was nobly done, but the treasure...

61
03:25:38,062 --> 03:25:39,729
...does not belong to the people...

62
03:25:39,981 --> 03:25:41,231
...of Lake-town.

63
03:25:41,482 --> 03:25:42,482
This gold...

64
03:25:46,528 --> 03:25:48,071
...is ours.

65
03:25:51,241 --> 03:25:52,493
And ours alone.

66
03:25:55,997 --> 03:25:57,580
By my life...

67
03:25:58,499 --> 03:26:01,417
...I will not part...

68
03:26:02,169 --> 03:26:05,464
...with a single coin.

69
03:26:07,133 --> 03:26:08,758
Not...

70
03:26:09,761 --> 03:26:11,261
...one...

71
03:26:11,845 --> 03:26:13,846
...piece of it.
