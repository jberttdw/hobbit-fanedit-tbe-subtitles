1
02:15:48,924 --> 02:15:51,609
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

2
02:15:52,204 --> 02:15:55,253
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

3
02:15:55,484 --> 02:15:57,532
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

4
02:15:57,804 --> 02:15:59,004
Say what you like about our...

5
02:15:59,124 --> 02:16:02,446
ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.

6
02:16:03,444 --> 02:16:04,969
Come, Elros, try it.

7
02:16:05,684 --> 02:16:07,765
I have the Dwarves...
...in my charge.

8
02:16:08,164 --> 02:16:11,088
They're locked up. Where can they go?
Ha, ha.

9
02:16:14,164 --> 02:16:16,735
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

10
02:16:16,964 --> 02:16:18,693
Must be nearly dawn.

11
02:16:18,924 --> 02:16:21,245
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

12
02:16:24,204 --> 02:16:26,286
Not stuck in here, you're not.

13
02:16:32,244 --> 02:16:32,893
Bilbo!

14
02:16:33,124 --> 02:16:34,011
What?

15
02:16:35,924 --> 02:16:38,495
Shh! There are guards nearby!

16
02:16:44,244 --> 02:16:45,166
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.

17
02:16:45,404 --> 02:16:47,611
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

18
02:16:58,404 --> 02:17:00,004
- Up the stairs.
- You first.

19
02:17:00,124 --> 02:17:00,727
Ori.

20
02:17:00,964 --> 02:17:02,644
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

21
02:17:03,804 --> 02:17:04,646
Go.

22
02:17:04,884 --> 02:17:06,409
Easy, now.

23
02:17:21,484 --> 02:17:22,565
This way.
