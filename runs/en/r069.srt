Search them.

2
02:09:59,166 --> 02:10:01,294
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

3
02:10:01,566 --> 02:10:02,727
Who is this?

4
02:10:02,966 --> 02:10:06,012
- Your brother?
- That is... my wife!

5
02:10:06,286 --> 02:10:08,368
And what is this horrid creature?

6
02:10:08,646 --> 02:10:09,772
A Goblin-mutant?

7
02:10:10,006 --> 02:10:11,929
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

8
02:10:43,846 --> 02:10:45,246
Where did you get this?

9
02:10:45,606 --> 02:10:46,812
It was given to me.

10
02:10:50,366 --> 02:10:53,654
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

11
02:10:58,406 --> 02:10:59,931
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

12
02:12:03,566 --> 02:12:05,648
Unh! This is not the end of it!

13
02:12:06,486 --> 02:12:09,171
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!

14
02:12:09,446 --> 02:12:10,971
Get off me!
