03:46:56,971 --> 03:46:59,180
My children! Where are my children?

2
03:46:59,433 --> 03:47:02,350
I saw them!
They were down in the old market!

3
03:47:02,601 --> 03:47:03,810
The market?

4
03:47:04,312 --> 03:47:05,729
Where are they now?

5
03:47:05,980 --> 03:47:07,564
Tilda! Sigrid!

6
03:47:07,815 --> 03:47:10,483
Bard! Orcs are storming over the causeway!

7
03:47:11,403 --> 03:47:14,738
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them off as long as you can.

8
03:47:14,989 --> 03:47:16,991
Archers! This way!

9
03:47:17,242 --> 03:47:19,452
The Orcs have taken Stone Street!

10
03:47:19,702 --> 03:47:21,412
The market's overrun!

11
03:47:24,707 --> 03:47:26,250
The rest of you...

12
03:47:26,501 --> 03:47:27,835
...follow me!
