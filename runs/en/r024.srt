1
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,344
Not with your...

2
01:06:50,345 --> 01:06:52,346
...companions?

3
01:06:52,347 --> 01:06:57,347
Uh, no, I shan't be missed.

4
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:03,732
The truth is that most of them
don't think I should be on this journey.

5
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:06,443
Indeed?

6
01:07:06,444 --> 01:07:09,738
I've heard that Hobbits are very resilient.

7
01:07:13,034 --> 01:07:14,660
Really?

8
01:07:14,661 --> 01:07:19,661
Mm.

9
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:25,250
I've also heard they're fond
of the comforts of home.

10
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:31,093
I've heard that it's unwise
to seek the council of Elves.

11
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:36,094
That they will answer with yes and no.

12
01:07:42,814 --> 01:07:45,607
You are very welcome to stay here,
if that...

13
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:50,608
...is your wish.
