1
02:57:39,464 --> 02:57:40,465
You think you...

2
02:57:40,704 --> 02:57:42,672
can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

3
02:57:46,224 --> 02:57:49,228
You have come from Lake-town.

4
02:57:50,944 --> 02:57:52,230
This is some...

5
02:57:52,464 --> 02:57:55,752
sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

6
02:57:55,984 --> 02:57:59,147
and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

7
02:58:00,144 --> 02:58:02,067
Those sniveling cowards...

8
02:58:02,304 --> 02:58:03,794
with their long bows...

9
02:58:04,024 --> 02:58:06,868
and Black Arrows.

10
02:58:07,224 --> 02:58:09,113
Perhaps it is time...

11
02:58:09,384 --> 02:58:11,273
I paid them a visit.

12
02:58:11,784 --> 02:58:13,024
No.

13
02:58:14,904 --> 02:58:16,394
This isn't their fault!

14
02:58:16,624 --> 02:58:17,432
Wait!

15
02:58:17,664 --> 02:58:19,268
You cannot go to Lake-town!

16
02:58:21,184 --> 02:58:23,346
You care about them...

17
02:58:24,064 --> 02:58:25,304
you?

18
02:58:25,544 --> 02:58:26,511
Good.

19
02:58:27,224 --> 02:58:29,634
Then you can...
...watch them die.
