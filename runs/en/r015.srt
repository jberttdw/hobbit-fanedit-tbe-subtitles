1
00:52:35,263 --> 00:52:39,349
They could not have moved in daylight.

2
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,645
There must be a cave nearby.

3
00:52:52,405 --> 00:52:54,907
Oh, what's that stench?

4
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:58,368
It's a Troll-hoard.

5
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:01,163
Be careful what you touch.

6
00:53:13,426 --> 00:53:15,385
Seems a shame just to leave it...

7
00:53:15,386 --> 00:53:18,597
...lying around.

8
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,724
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.

9
00:53:20,725 --> 00:53:22,559
- Nori.
Yeah?

10
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,560
Get a shovel.

11
00:53:41,162 --> 00:53:46,162
These swords were not made by any Troll.

12
00:53:49,212 --> 00:53:54,212
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.

13
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:00,430
These were forged in Gondolin...

14
00:54:00,431 --> 00:54:05,102
...by the High Elves of the First Age.
You could not...

15
00:54:05,103 --> 00:54:10,103
...wish for a finer blade.

16
00:54:20,618 --> 00:54:23,412
Set it down.
That's good.

17
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:28,413
All right, come on. Quick.

18
00:54:33,381 --> 00:54:36,717
We're making a long-term deposit.

19
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:38,719
Let's get out of this foul place.

20
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,595
Come on, let's go.

21
00:54:40,596 --> 00:54:45,596
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

22
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:05,203
Bilbo.
Hmm?

23
00:55:05,204 --> 00:55:06,455
Here.

24
00:55:06,456 --> 00:55:11,456
This is about your size.

25
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:16,381
I can't take this.

26
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:18,592
The blade is of Elvish make...

27
00:55:18,593 --> 00:55:20,302
...which means...

28
00:55:20,303 --> 00:55:24,681
...it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

29
00:55:24,682 --> 00:55:27,225
I have never used a sword in my life.

30
00:55:27,226 --> 00:55:30,103
And I hope you never have to.

31
00:55:30,104 --> 00:55:33,190
But if you do, remember this:

32
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:38,191
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

33
00:55:39,155 --> 00:55:44,155
...but when to spare one.
