1
02:45:40,429 --> 02:45:41,510
Hello?

2
02:46:00,549 --> 02:46:01,960
He's not at home.

3
02:46:02,909 --> 02:46:04,593
Not at home. Ahem.

4
02:46:05,429 --> 02:46:06,510
Good.

5
02:46:08,309 --> 02:46:10,038
Good, good, good.

6
02:47:04,229 --> 02:47:04,798
What's that?

7
02:47:08,909 --> 02:47:10,877
Shush. Shush.

8
02:47:12,189 --> 02:47:13,475
Arkenstone.

9
02:47:14,509 --> 02:47:15,920
Arkenstone.

10
02:47:16,749 --> 02:47:18,797
A large, white jewel.

11
02:47:20,989 --> 02:47:22,354
Very helpful.

12
02:49:47,949 --> 02:49:49,360
Well...

13
02:49:51,029 --> 02:49:52,315
thief.

14
02:49:54,309 --> 02:49:57,950
I smell you.

15
02:49:58,309 --> 02:50:01,518
I hear your breath.

16
02:50:02,829 --> 02:50:04,433
I feel...

17
02:50:04,709 --> 02:50:05,631
your air.

18
02:50:09,549 --> 02:50:12,075
Where are you?

19
02:50:13,549 --> 02:50:14,630
Where are you?

20
02:50:34,749 --> 02:50:35,750
Come, now...

21
02:50:36,509 --> 02:50:38,637
don't be shy.

22
02:50:38,909 --> 02:50:41,116
Step into the light.

23
02:50:48,029 --> 02:50:51,238
There is something about you.

24
02:50:54,629 --> 02:50:56,511
Something you... carry.

25
02:50:57,669 --> 02:51:00,559
Something made of gold.

26
02:51:01,309 --> 02:51:06,278
But far more... precious.

27
02:51:06,509 --> 02:51:08,830
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

28
02:51:11,629 --> 02:51:12,790
There you are...

29
02:51:13,069 --> 02:51:16,672
Thief in the... Shadows.

30
02:51:18,509 --> 02:51:21,115
I did not come to steal from you...

31
02:51:21,349 --> 02:51:22,157
O Smaug...

32
02:51:22,389 --> 02:51:25,632
the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

33
02:51:25,909 --> 02:51:27,513
to gaze upon your magnificence.

34
02:51:27,869 --> 02:51:28,711
To see...

35
02:51:28,949 --> 02:51:31,919
if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

36
02:51:32,629 --> 02:51:34,358
I did not believe them.

37
02:51:43,189 --> 02:51:47,114
And do you now?!

38
02:51:48,469 --> 02:51:49,709
Truly...

39
02:51:51,029 --> 02:51:53,236
the tales and songs...

40
02:51:54,349 --> 02:51:57,080
fall utterly short of your enormity...

41
02:51:57,309 --> 02:52:00,279
O Smaug the Stupendous.

42
02:52:00,509 --> 02:52:03,399
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

43
02:52:03,909 --> 02:52:04,876
No, no.

44
02:52:05,109 --> 02:52:06,599
No, indeed.

45
02:52:08,869 --> 02:52:12,112
You seem familiar with my name...

46
02:52:12,349 --> 02:52:15,239
but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.

47
02:52:16,349 --> 02:52:17,953
Who are you...

48
02:52:18,189 --> 02:52:20,715
and where do you come from...

49
02:52:20,949 --> 02:52:23,270
may I ask?

50
02:52:32,829 --> 02:52:34,513
I come from under the hill.

51
02:52:34,869 --> 02:52:36,280
Underhill?

52
02:52:39,989 --> 02:52:40,989
And under hills...

53
02:52:41,109 --> 02:52:43,111
and over hills my path has led.

54
02:52:43,989 --> 02:52:44,831
And... And...

55
02:52:45,589 --> 02:52:47,956
through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

56
02:52:48,189 --> 02:52:49,918
Impressive.

57
02:52:50,149 --> 02:52:52,197
What else do you claim to be?

58
02:52:53,149 --> 02:52:53,957
I am...

59
02:52:57,189 --> 02:52:58,679
Luck-wearer.

60
02:53:00,109 --> 02:53:01,270
Riddle-maker.

61
02:53:01,549 --> 02:53:03,199
Lovely titles.

62
02:53:03,909 --> 02:53:05,070
Go on.

63
02:53:05,349 --> 02:53:06,430
Barrel-rider.

64
02:53:06,669 --> 02:53:10,071
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

65
02:53:11,549 --> 02:53:12,277
And what about...

66
02:53:12,509 --> 02:53:15,479
your little Dwarf friends?

67
02:53:16,589 --> 02:53:17,829
Where are they hiding?

68
02:53:20,709 --> 02:53:22,279
Dwarves?

69
02:53:23,109 --> 02:53:24,190
No.

70
02:53:24,869 --> 02:53:26,394
No, no. No Dwarves here.

71
02:53:26,629 --> 02:53:27,710
You've got that all wrong.

72
02:53:27,989 --> 02:53:31,755
I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

73
02:53:32,309 --> 02:53:33,549
They sent you in here...

74
02:53:33,829 --> 02:53:35,797
to do their dirty work while they...

75
02:53:36,029 --> 02:53:37,997
skulk about outside.

76
02:53:39,229 --> 02:53:40,390
Truly...

77
02:53:41,189 --> 02:53:42,350
you are mistaken...

78
02:53:42,629 --> 02:53:45,633
O Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.

79
02:53:45,869 --> 02:53:49,271
You have nice manners...

80
02:53:49,509 --> 02:53:52,631
for a thief and... a liar!

81
02:53:53,989 --> 02:53:57,391
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

82
02:53:57,829 --> 02:53:59,035
No one better!

83
02:54:00,749 --> 02:54:02,160
It is the gold!

84
02:54:02,389 --> 02:54:04,436
They are drawn... to
treasure like...

85
02:54:04,669 --> 02:54:06,239
flies to dead flesh.

86
02:54:09,789 --> 02:54:11,029
Did you think I did not know...

87
02:54:11,469 --> 02:54:12,959
this day would come?!

88
02:54:14,829 --> 02:54:17,680
That a pack of...
...canting Dwarves...

89
02:54:17,909 --> 02:54:20,230
would come crawling back...

90
02:54:20,789 --> 02:54:22,029
to the mountain?!
