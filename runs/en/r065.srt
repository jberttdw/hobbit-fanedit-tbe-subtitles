1
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:53,062
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

2
01:58:53,296 --> 01:58:56,027
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.

3
01:58:56,456 --> 01:58:58,185
"Lead us astray"?

4
01:58:58,616 --> 01:58:59,981
What does that mean?

5
01:59:00,336 --> 01:59:03,465
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.

6
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,938
If you do, you'll never...

7
01:59:06,176 --> 01:59:07,462
find it again.

8
01:59:09,136 --> 01:59:10,706
No matter what may come, stay on...

9
01:59:10,936 --> 01:59:11,619
the path!

10
01:59:11,856 --> 01:59:15,019
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

11
01:59:15,256 --> 01:59:16,257
- Durin's Day?
- Let's go.

12
01:59:16,536 --> 01:59:19,016
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

13
01:59:29,776 --> 01:59:31,426
The path turns this way.

14
01:59:57,456 --> 01:59:58,662
This way.

15
02:00:07,256 --> 02:00:10,419
Air. I need air.

16
02:00:10,656 --> 02:00:12,704
My head, it's swimming!
