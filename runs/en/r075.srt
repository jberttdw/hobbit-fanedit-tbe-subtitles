1
02:22:53,414 --> 02:22:53,983
Watch out!

2
02:23:03,174 --> 02:23:03,777
What are you trying...

3
02:23:04,054 --> 02:23:05,704
to do, drown us?

4
02:23:05,974 --> 02:23:08,545
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.

5
02:23:08,774 --> 02:23:10,185
If I wanted to drown you...

6
02:23:10,414 --> 02:23:12,018
I would not do it here.

7
02:23:14,094 --> 02:23:16,495
I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

8
02:23:16,774 --> 02:23:19,505
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.

9
02:23:19,774 --> 02:23:22,220
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?

10
02:23:22,814 --> 02:23:24,225
I asked him.

11
02:23:24,494 --> 02:23:27,065
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

12
02:23:27,294 --> 02:23:28,864
We do not have to like him.

13
02:23:29,094 --> 02:23:30,744
We simply have to pay him.

14
02:23:31,054 --> 02:23:32,783
Come on now, lads. Turn out...

15
02:23:33,014 --> 02:23:33,981
your pockets.

16
02:23:35,254 --> 02:23:36,824
How do we know he won't betray us?

17
02:23:37,054 --> 02:23:38,294
We don't.

18
02:23:39,254 --> 02:23:39,934
There's...

19
02:23:40,374 --> 02:23:41,341
just a wee problem.

20
02:23:42,574 --> 02:23:44,019
We're 10 coins short.

21
02:23:46,174 --> 02:23:46,823
Gloin.

22
02:23:48,454 --> 02:23:49,057
Come on.

23
02:23:49,294 --> 02:23:51,422
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

24
02:23:52,494 --> 02:23:56,175
I have been bled dry...
...by this venture.

25
02:23:56,494 --> 02:23:57,461
What have I seen...

26
02:23:57,734 --> 02:23:59,020
for my investment?

27
02:23:59,854 --> 02:24:02,741
Naught but misery and...
...grief and...

28
02:24:11,094 --> 02:24:13,062
Bless my beard.

29
02:24:13,894 --> 02:24:15,055
Take it.

30
02:24:16,174 --> 02:24:17,585
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.

31
02:24:21,414 --> 02:24:22,749
The money, quick. Give it to me.

32
02:24:22,774 --> 02:24:23,502
We will pay you when we...

33
02:24:23,734 --> 02:24:25,463
get our provisions but not before.

34
02:24:25,694 --> 02:24:28,174
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

35
02:24:28,614 --> 02:24:29,900
There are guards ahead.

36
02:24:48,454 --> 02:24:49,819
What's he doing?

37
02:24:50,174 --> 02:24:51,414
He's talking to someone.

38
02:24:54,014 --> 02:24:55,095
He's pointing right at us.

39
02:24:58,494 --> 02:24:59,063
Now they're...

40
02:24:59,334 --> 02:25:00,015
shaking hands.

41
02:25:00,174 --> 02:25:01,619
- What?
- The villain.

42
02:25:01,854 --> 02:25:03,185
He's selling us out.

43
02:25:26,174 --> 02:25:27,096
Quiet.

44
02:25:29,894 --> 02:25:31,623
We're approaching the tollgate.

45
02:25:42,974 --> 02:25:43,816
Halt!

46
02:25:44,134 --> 02:25:45,465
Goods inspection!

47
02:25:46,214 --> 02:25:48,057
Papers, please!

48
02:25:48,814 --> 02:25:50,054
It's you, Bard.

49
02:25:50,294 --> 02:25:51,341
Morning, Percy.

50
02:25:51,574 --> 02:25:52,780
Anything to declare?

51
02:25:53,054 --> 02:25:55,785
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...

52
02:25:56,054 --> 02:25:57,101
and ready for home.

53
02:25:57,334 --> 02:25:58,574
You and me both.

54
02:26:02,694 --> 02:26:04,105
There we are.

55
02:26:04,334 --> 02:26:05,176
All in order.
