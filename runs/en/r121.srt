1
03:33:24,870 --> 03:33:26,578
I will put the next one between your eyes.

2
03:33:51,562 --> 03:33:52,854
We have come to tell you...

3
03:33:53,107 --> 03:33:56,359
...payment of your debt has been offered...

4
03:33:56,609 --> 03:33:58,069
...and accepted.

5
03:33:59,529 --> 03:34:00,529
What payment?

6
03:34:01,698 --> 03:34:02,990
I gave you nothing.

7
03:34:03,741 --> 03:34:05,493
You have nothing.

8
03:34:12,417 --> 03:34:13,875
We have this.

9
03:34:17,756 --> 03:34:19,173
They have the Arkenstone.

10
03:34:20,801 --> 03:34:21,926
Thieves!

11
03:34:22,553 --> 03:34:25,680
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?

12
03:34:25,930 --> 03:34:27,432
That stone belongs to the king!

13
03:34:29,017 --> 03:34:30,267
And the king may have it...

14
03:34:31,144 --> 03:34:32,644
...with our goodwill.

15
03:34:37,567 --> 03:34:41,528
But first he must honor his word.

16
03:34:43,991 --> 03:34:45,700
They are taking us for fools.

17
03:34:47,411 --> 03:34:48,786
This is a ruse.

18
03:34:50,371 --> 03:34:52,122
A filthy lie.

19
03:34:53,459 --> 03:34:56,376
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!

20
03:34:56,627 --> 03:34:57,754
It is a trick!

21
03:34:58,005 --> 03:34:59,630
It's no trick.

22
03:35:00,799 --> 03:35:02,090
The stone is real.

23
03:35:03,634 --> 03:35:05,219
I gave it to them.

24
03:35:13,437 --> 03:35:14,437
You?

25
03:35:16,814 --> 03:35:19,024
I took it as my 14th share.

26
03:35:20,902 --> 03:35:22,737
You would steal from me?

27
03:35:22,987 --> 03:35:24,154
Steal from you? No.

28
03:35:24,406 --> 03:35:27,617
No, I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.

29
03:35:30,828 --> 03:35:32,746
I'll let it stand against my claim.

30
03:35:33,247 --> 03:35:35,041
Against your claim?

31
03:35:36,794 --> 03:35:38,460
Your claim.

32
03:35:39,337 --> 03:35:42,298
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!

33
03:35:44,843 --> 03:35:46,719
I was going to give it to you.

34
03:35:47,720 --> 03:35:50,680
- Many times I wanted to, but...
- But what...

35
03:35:50,933 --> 03:35:52,224
...thief?

36
03:35:52,809 --> 03:35:54,727
You are changed, Thorin.

37
03:35:54,978 --> 03:35:55,978
The Dwarf I met...

38
03:35:56,229 --> 03:35:59,107
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word.

39
03:35:59,358 --> 03:36:00,608
Would never have doubted...

40
03:36:00,858 --> 03:36:02,402
...the loyalty of his kin!

41
03:36:03,152 --> 03:36:05,404
Do not speak to me...

42
03:36:06,115 --> 03:36:07,447
...of loyalty.

43
03:36:11,036 --> 03:36:12,286
Throw him from the rampart!

44
03:36:21,546 --> 03:36:22,587
Did you not hear me?

45
03:36:26,175 --> 03:36:27,969
I will do it myself. Curse you!

46
03:36:29,220 --> 03:36:29,804
No!

47
03:36:30,054 --> 03:36:31,304
Cursed be the Wizard...

48
03:36:31,557 --> 03:36:34,392
- ...that forced you on us!
- If you don't like my burglar...

49
03:36:34,643 --> 03:36:35,643
...then please...

50
03:36:35,768 --> 03:36:36,768
...don't damage him.

51
03:36:36,894 --> 03:36:38,145
Return him to me.

52
03:36:42,984 --> 03:36:46,987
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain...

53
03:36:47,238 --> 03:36:51,075
...are you, Thorin...

54
03:36:51,326 --> 03:36:52,492
...son of Thrain?

55
03:36:59,417 --> 03:37:01,626
Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!

56
03:37:01,879 --> 03:37:02,461
Go.

57
03:37:02,712 --> 03:37:03,712
Or Shire rats!

58
03:37:08,634 --> 03:37:10,260
Are we resolved?

59
03:37:11,220 --> 03:37:12,220
The return...

60
03:37:12,473 --> 03:37:14,432
...of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?
