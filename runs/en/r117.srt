1
03:27:35,368 --> 03:27:36,993
Not just for the treasure within...

2
03:27:37,245 --> 03:27:40,830
...but for where it lies,
its strategic position.

3
03:27:41,540 --> 03:27:42,750
This is the gateway...

4
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:46,169
...to reclaiming
the lands of Angmar in the North.

5
03:27:46,421 --> 03:27:49,589
If that fell kingdom should rise again...

6
03:27:50,133 --> 03:27:53,718
...Rivendell, Lórien, the Shire...

7
03:27:53,970 --> 03:27:55,763
...even Gondor itself, will fall.

8
03:27:56,513 --> 03:27:59,600
These Orc armies you speak of,
Mithrandir...

9
03:28:00,560 --> 03:28:02,018
...where are they?
