1
02:43:45,011 --> 02:43:48,538
You want me to find a jewel?

2
02:43:50,091 --> 02:43:51,820
A large, white jewel.

3
02:43:52,251 --> 02:43:53,377
Yes.

4
02:43:54,771 --> 02:43:57,342
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

5
02:43:57,691 --> 02:44:00,900
There is only one Arkenstone...

6
02:44:01,651 --> 02:44:03,733
and you'll know it when you see it.

7
02:44:04,851 --> 02:44:05,977
Right.

8
02:44:09,731 --> 02:44:11,458
In truth... lad...

9
02:44:12,251 --> 02:44:14,299
I do not know...

10
02:44:14,531 --> 02:44:16,613
what you will find down there.

11
02:44:18,731 --> 02:44:21,894
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

12
02:44:22,131 --> 02:44:23,098
No, Balin.

13
02:44:24,331 --> 02:44:26,379
I promised I would do this...

14
02:44:27,051 --> 02:44:28,780
and I think I must try.

15
02:44:33,451 --> 02:44:35,180
It never ceases to amaze me.

16
02:44:35,411 --> 02:44:36,219
What's that?

17
02:44:36,491 --> 02:44:38,175
The courage of Hobbits.

18
02:44:40,571 --> 02:44:41,811
Go now...

19
02:44:42,331 --> 02:44:46,336
with as much luck as you can muster.

20
02:44:53,531 --> 02:44:54,817
Bilbo?

21
02:44:57,251 --> 02:44:59,538
If there is, in fact...

22
02:45:01,051 --> 02:45:03,178
a live dragon...
...down there...

23
02:45:06,211 --> 02:45:07,622
don't waken it.
