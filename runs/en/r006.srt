1
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:53,041
Dwalin, at your service.

2
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,960
Hm. Uh...

3
00:06:55,961 --> 00:07:00,173
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.

4
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:01,299
Do we...

5
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,051
...know each other?

6
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:05,219
No.

7
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,013
Which way, laddie?

8
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,514
Is it down here?

9
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,599
Is what...

10
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,059
...down where?

11
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,769
<i>Supper.</i>

12
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,647
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

13
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:20,648
He-- He said? Who said?

14
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:25,986
Mmm.

15
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,452
Mmm.

16
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:32,914
Very good, this. Any more?

17
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:35,333
What? Oh, yes, yes.

18
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:40,334
Ah.

19
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:46,803
Help yourself.

20
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:51,804
Hmm. It's just that, urn,
I wasn't expecting company.

21
00:07:55,521 --> 00:08:00,521
That'll be the door.

22
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:02,652
Balin...

23
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:05,530
...at your service.

24
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:06,572
Good evening.

25
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,991
Yes. Yes, it is.

26
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:11,661
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?

27
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,454
Am I late?

28
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:15,790
Late for what?

29
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:16,749
Oh!

30
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,626
Ha, ha!

31
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,545
Evening, brother.

32
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:24,006
By my beard...

33
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:27,176
...you're shorter and wider than last we met.

34
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:29,387
Wider, not shorter.

35
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:32,473
Sharp enough for both of us.

36
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:43,943
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.

37
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:48,239
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure
you're in the right house.

38
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,450
Have you eaten?
It's not that I don't like...

39
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,285
...visitors. I like visitors...

40
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:54,579
...as much as the next Hobbit.

41
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,332
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.

42
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,834
- What is this?
- I don't know.

43
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:02,962
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.
It's riddled with mold.

44
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:07,963
The thing is, I don't know either of you.
Not in the slightest. I don't mean...

45
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:10,803
...to be blunt, but I had to speak my mind.

46
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:13,264
- I'm sorry.
You think--?

47
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,185
Apology accepted.

48
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:18,853
- Ah.
Now, fill it up, brother...

49
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:19,771
...don't stint.

50
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:24,734
You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.

51
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,196
- Fili.
- And Kili.

52
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:30,198
At your service.

53
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,783
You must be Mr. Boggins.

54
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,118
Nope! You can't come in.
You've come to the wrong house.

55
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,244
What?

56
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:38,039
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.

57
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,624
No, nothing's been canceled.

58
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:44,625
That's a relief.

59
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:46,297
Careful with these.

60
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,716
I just had them sharpened.

61
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:50,635
-It's nice, this place.
Yeah.

62
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:54,096
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.

63
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:57,141
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?

64
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:59,936
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

65
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:03,064
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

66
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:06,275
Shove this in the hallway.
Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

67
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:09,320
"Everyone"? How many more are there?
Where do you want this?

68
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:11,405
- Oh, no.
It's really heavy.

69
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:14,200
No. No. There's nobody home!

70
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:17,119
Go away and bother somebody else.

71
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,498
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.

72
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:24,627
If this is some clot-head's idea of a joke...

73
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:27,296
...I can only say it is in very...

74
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,006
...poor taste.

75
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:31,342
Get off...

76
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:32,718
...you big lump!

77
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,725
Gandalf.
