1
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,160
- Again!
- Leave it!

2
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:27,251
There's no way out!

3
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:29,482
This is no Orc dungeon.

4
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,240
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

5
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:36,320
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

6
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,561
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

7
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:48,044
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

8
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,049
and slay a dragon.

9
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:55,445
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

10
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,970
Attempted burglary.

11
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:01,007
Or something of that ilk.

12
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:06,161
You have found... a way in.

13
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,575
You seek that which would...

14
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:10,604
bestow upon you the right to rule.

15
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:13,169
The King's Jewel.

16
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:15,570
The Arkenstone.

17
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:21,162
It is precious to you beyond measure.

18
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,889
I understand that.

19
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:28,481
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

20
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:33,088
White gems... of
pure starlight.

21
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:36,407
I offer you my help.

22
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:40,965
I am listening.

23
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:42,844
I will let you go...

24
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:46,525
if you but return what is mine.

25
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:51,051
A favor for a favor.

26
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:52,400
You have my word.

27
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:56,166
One king to another.

28
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:03,563
I would not trust Thranduil...

29
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:05,567
the great king...

30
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:06,961
to honor his word...

31
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:09,726
should the end of all days
be upon us!

32
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:10,929
You...

33
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:13,641
who lack all... honor!

34
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:16,768
I have seen how you treat your friends.

35
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:21,081
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

36
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,765
seeking your help.

37
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:25,687
But you turned your back!

38
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,607
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

39
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:31,848
and the inferno that destroyed us.

40
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:36,522
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

41
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:37,569
I know...

42
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:40,081
its wrath and ruin.

43
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:45,446
I have faced...

44
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:48,485
the great serpents of the North.

45
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:51,360
I warned your...

46
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:54,848
grandfather of what his greed
would summon.

47
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,323
But he would not listen.

48
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,928
You are just like him.

49
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:10,970
Stay here if you will...
...and rot.

50
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:13,123
A hundred years is a mere blink...

51
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,362
in the life of an Elf.

52
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:17,284
I'm patient.

53
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:20,322
I can wait.

54
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:28,881
Did he offer you a deal?

55
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,281
He did.

56
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,367
I told him he could go
<i>îsh kakhfê ai-'d dûr-rugnu!</i>

57
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:36,928
Him and all his kin!

58
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,724
Well, that's that, then.

59
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:44,920
A deal was our only hope.
