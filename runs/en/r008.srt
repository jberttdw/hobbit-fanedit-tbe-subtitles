1
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,084
Put that back.

2
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,377
Put that back.

3
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,294
Not the jam please.

4
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:46,462
Excuse me. Excuse me.

5
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:49,548
It's a tad excessive, isn't it?
Have you got a cheese knife?

6
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,593
-"Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.
Ugh.

7
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:56,180
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair--
No, so is that. Take it back, please.

8
00:10:56,181 --> 00:11:00,559
- I cannot hear what you're saying.
It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

9
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,560
That is a book, not a coaster.
And put that map down.

10
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:08,317
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?

11
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:11,153
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

12
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:16,154
Oh, no, thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.

13
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:23,332
Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.

14
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,377
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

15
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:28,671
Oin, Gloin.

16
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:31,841
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

17
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,719
-...Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

18
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,971
No, thank you.

19
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,101
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

20
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,603
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

21
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:49,604
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

22
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:54,113
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine,
as requested.

23
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,323
It's got a fruity bouquet.

24
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:58,826
Oh. Cheers.

25
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:03,330
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.

26
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,582
Hmm.

27
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,461
No chance. Not from that distance.

28
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,588
Wanna bet? Bombur...

29
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,089
...catch!

30
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:16,802
I'll help you with that.

31
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:24,560
Oh, you great...

32
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:25,853
...galumphing git!

33
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:27,146
Who wants an ale? There you go.

34
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,064
Over here, brother.

35
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:30,316
I said have another...

36
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,526
...drink. Here you go.

37
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:38,991
Ale on the count of three!

38
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:39,909
One...

39
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,910
-...two...
- Up!

40
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:54,465
I knew you had it in you!

41
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:57,259
Excuse me, that is a doily, not a dishcloth.

42
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,552
But it's full of holes.

43
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:00,971
It's supposed to look like that. It's crochet.

44
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:04,141
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.

45
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:06,227
Bebother and confusticate these Dwarves!

46
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:09,146
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

47
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:12,149
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by Dwarves.

48
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,901
What are they doing here?

49
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:17,822
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering
once you get used to them.

50
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:19,949
I don't want to get used to them.

51
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,285
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.

52
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:24,870
They've pillaged the pantry.

53
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,456
I won't tell you what they've done
in the bathroom.

54
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:31,502
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!

55
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:36,503
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?

56
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:41,883
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

57
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:44,765
Take that back.

58
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:45,891
Excuse me.

59
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,184
That's my mother's...

60
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:48,936
...West Farthing pottery. It's over...

61
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:53,566
...100 years old!

62
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:54,483
And can you...

63
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:55,484
...not do that?

64
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:56,402
You'll blunt them.

65
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,946
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

66
00:13:58,947 --> 00:13:59,989
He says...

67
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,907
...we'll blunt the knives.

68
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,993
<i>Blunt the knives, bend the forks</i>

69
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:06,662
<i>Smash the bottles and burn the corks</i>

70
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:09,623
<i>Chip the glasses and crack the plates</i>

71
00:14:09,624 --> 00:14:11,208
<i>That's what Bilbo Baggins</i>

72
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,126
<i>Hates</i>

73
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:13,752
<i>Cut the cloth, tread on the fat</i>

74
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,796
<i>Leave the bones on the bedroom mat</i>

75
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:19,466
<i>Pour the milk on the pantry floor</i>

76
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,801
<i>Splash the wine</i>

77
00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:21,719
<i>On every door</i>

78
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,512
<i>Dump the crooks in a boiling bowl</i>

79
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:25,306
<i>Pound them up with a thumping pole</i>

80
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,223
<i>When you're finished</i>

81
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:30,394
<i>If they are whole</i>

82
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:35,395
<i>Send them down the hall to roll</i>

83
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,573
<i>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!</i>

84
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:49,288
Bilbo.

85
00:14:56,338 --> 00:15:01,338
He is here.

86
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:05,054
Gandalf.

87
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,096
I thought you said...

88
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:07,389
...this place would be easy...

89
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,142
...to find. I lost my way, twice.

90
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,812
I wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.

91
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,941
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.

92
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:20,778
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

93
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,449
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company:

94
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,618
Thorin Oakenshield.

95
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:30,663
So...

96
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,415
...this is the Hobbit.

97
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,960
Tell me, Mr. Baggins,
have you done much fighting?

98
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,087
- Pardon me?
Axe or sword?

99
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,797
What's your weapon of choice?

100
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:43,467
Well, I do have some skill at conkers,
if you must know...

101
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:47,429
...but I fail to see why that's relevant.

102
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,223
Thought as much.

103
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:52,226
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.

104
00:15:57,232 --> 00:15:58,148
What news...

105
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,151
...from the meeting in Ered Luin?
Did they all come?

106
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:04,405
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.
All of them!

107
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:08,117
DWALIN: And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?

108
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:12,413
Is Dain with us?

109
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,081
They will not come.

110
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,210
They say this quest...

111
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:23,211
...is ours and ours alone.

112
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,760
You're going on a quest?

113
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:31,761
Bilbo, my dear fellow,
let us have a little more light.

114
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,977
Far to the east...

115
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:38,022
...over ranges and rivers...

116
00:16:38,023 --> 00:16:41,525
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...

117
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:46,526
...lies a single, solitary peak.

118
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:49,783
"The Lonely Mountain."

119
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:52,119
Aye, Oin has read...

120
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,790
...the portents,
and the portents say it is time.

121
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,042
Ravens have been seen...

122
00:16:58,043 --> 00:17:01,837
...flying back to the mountain,
as it was foretold.

123
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:04,631
"When the birds of yore return...

124
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:05,966
...to Erebor...

125
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,718
...the reign of the beast...

126
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:12,514
...will end."

127
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:14,892
- Uh, what beast?
That would be a reference...

128
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,393
...to Smaug the Terrible...

129
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:17,895
...chiefest and greatest...

130
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:21,065
...calamity of our age.

131
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:22,983
Airborne fire-breather.

132
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:24,234
Teeth like razors...

133
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:25,944
...claws like meat hooks.

134
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,488
Extremely fond of precious metals.

135
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:28,947
I know what a dragon is.

136
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,908
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

137
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:33,911
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron
right up his jacksie!

138
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:34,828
Good lad, Ori!

139
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:35,746
Sit down.

140
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:37,164
The task would be difficult...

141
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:38,791
...with an army behind us...

142
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,126
...but we number just 13.

143
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,629
And not 13 of the best...

144
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,255
...nor brightest.

145
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:47,591
Here, who are you calling dim?

146
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,301
Sorry, what did he say?

147
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,970
We may be few in number...

148
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:55,224
...but we're fighters, all of us...

149
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:56,475
...to the last Dwarf.

150
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,894
And you forget,
we have a Wizard in our company.

151
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:01,480
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons.

152
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,649
Oh, well, no. I-- I wouldn't say--

153
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,818
How many, then?
- What?

154
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,862
How many dragons have you killed?

155
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,281
Go on.

156
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:13,033
Give us a number.

157
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,329
Excuse me. Please.

158
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,793
If we have read these signs...

159
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:27,756
...do you not think others
will have read them too?

160
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:30,717
Rumors have begun to spread.

161
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:35,055
The dragon, Smaug,
has not been seen for 60 years.

162
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:38,183
Eyes look east to the mountain, assessing...

163
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,895
...wondering, weighing the risk.

164
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:44,898
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.

165
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:49,069
Do we sit back while others claim
what is rightfully ours?

166
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,238
Or do we seize this chance...

167
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,197
...to take back Erebor?

168
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:57,452
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

169
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:58,579
There is no way...

170
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,706
...into the mountain.

171
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:05,707
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

172
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,965
How came you by this?

173
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,216
It was given to me...

174
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,051
...by your father.

175
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,803
By Thrain.

176
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:17,139
For safekeeping.

177
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,098
It is yours...

178
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:23,099
...now.

179
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:29,026
If there is a key...

180
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:31,236
...there must be a door.

181
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,154
These runes...

182
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:35,949
...speak of a hidden passage
to the Lower Halls.

183
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,285
There's another way in.

184
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:42,289
Well, if we can find it,
but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

185
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,461
The answer lies hidden somewhere
in this map...

186
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:49,671
...and I do not have the skill to find it.

187
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:54,672
But there are others in Middle-earth
who can.

188
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:58,347
The task I have in mind
will require a great deal of stealth...

189
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:02,184
...and no small amount of courage.

190
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:06,563
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.

191
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,440
That's why we need a burglar.

192
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,110
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.

193
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:16,823
And are you?

194
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,450
Am I what?

195
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,703
He said he's an expert. Hey.

196
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:26,704
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

197
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,628
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree
with Mr. Baggins.

198
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,838
He's hardly burglar material.

199
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,507
Nope.

200
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:37,511
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk
who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

201
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:39,846
He's just fine.

202
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:46,353
Enough!

203
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:48,146
If I say Bilbo Baggins...

204
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,856
...is a burglar, then a burglar...

205
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:52,859
...he is.

206
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,319
Hobbits are light...

207
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,699
...on their feet. In fact, they can pass
unseen by most, if they choose.

208
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,494
And, while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of Dwarf...

209
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,955
...the scent of a Hobbit is all but...

210
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:09,084
...unknown to him,
which gives us a distinct advantage.

211
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,962
You asked me to find
the 14th member of this company...

212
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,755
...and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

213
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:15,173
There's more to him...

214
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,883
...than appearances suggest.

215
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:21,305
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.

216
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:26,306
Including himself.

217
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:33,396
You must trust me on this.

218
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,610
Very well.

219
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,404
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.

220
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:39,990
Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.

221
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:42,117
It's just the usual. Summary...

222
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:44,202
...of out-of-pocket expenses,
time required...

223
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,203
...remuneration...

224
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,956
...funeral arrangements, so forth.

225
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:52,336
Funeral arrangements?

226
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,341
I cannot guarantee his safety.

227
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,051
Understood.

228
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:04,052
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

229
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:07,017
Agreed.

230
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:07,934
"Terms: Cash on...

231
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:11,772
...delivery, up to but not exceeding
one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."

232
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,815
Hmm. Seems fair.

233
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:17,694
"Present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by...

234
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:22,695
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...

235
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:28,622
...evisceration..."

236
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:30,832
-incineration?
Aye.

237
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:35,833
He'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.

238
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:39,424
You all right, laddie?

239
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:42,719
Huh? Yeah.

240
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,471
Feel a bit faint.

241
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:46,640
- Think furnace with wings.
Air.

242
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,266
I need air.

243
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,435
Flash of light, searing pain, then:

244
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,188
Poof. You're nothing more than a pile of ash!

245
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:58,189
Hmm.

246
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,613
Nope.

247
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,824
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

248
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:07,119
I'll be all right.
Just let me sit quietly for a moment.

249
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,205
You've been sitting quietly for far too long.

250
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:12,040
Tell me...

251
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,543
...when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...

252
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,753
...become so important to you?

253
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:21,754
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

254
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,095
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...

255
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:28,890
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

256
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:31,560
A young Hobbit who would have liked
nothing better...

257
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:35,480
...than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.

258
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,398
The world...

259
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:40,318
...is not in your books and maps.

260
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,236
It's out...

261
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:44,197
...there.

262
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:46,658
I can't just go running off into the blue.

263
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,995
I am a Baggins... of Bag-end.

264
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,832
You are also a Took.

265
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,791
Did you know...

266
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,501
...that your great-great-great-great-uncle...

267
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,879
...Bullroarer Took was so large...

268
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,422
...he could ride a real horse?

269
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:01,590
- Yes.
- Yes...

270
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:02,757
...well, he could.

271
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,802
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.

272
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:09,806
He swung his club so hard,
it knocked the Goblin king's head clean off...

273
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:14,186
...and it sailed 100 yards through the air
and went down a rabbit hole.

274
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:16,646
And thus, the battle was won.

275
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:21,647
And the game of golf invented
at the same time.

276
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:25,238
I do believe you made that up.

277
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:30,239
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.

278
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:35,453
You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own
when you come back.

279
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,339
Can you promise that I will come back?

280
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,090
No.

281
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,927
And if you do...

282
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:50,805
...you will not be the same.

283
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:53,642
That's what I thought.

284
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:58,313
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

285
00:24:58,314 --> 00:25:03,314
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

286
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:11,660
It appears we have lost our burglar.

287
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:13,870
Probably for the best.

288
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:16,414
The odds were always against us.

289
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:19,918
After all, what are we?

290
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,338
Merchants, miners...

291
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:25,715
...tinkers, toy-makers.

292
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:29,135
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

293
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:32,639
There are a few warriors amongst us.

294
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,724
Old warriors.

295
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:37,310
I would take each and every one
of these Dwarves...

296
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:39,604
...over an army from the Iron Hills.

297
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:43,275
For when I called upon them,
they answered.

298
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:46,236
Loyalty, honor...

299
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:49,656
...a willing heart.

300
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:52,576
I can ask no more than that.

301
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:53,493
You don't...

302
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:55,412
...have to do this.

303
00:25:55,413 --> 00:25:57,247
You have a choice.

304
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,042
You've done honorably by our people.

305
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:05,130
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.

306
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,423
A life of peace...

307
00:26:06,424 --> 00:26:09,009
...and plenty.

308
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,010
A life that is worth more than
all the gold in Erebor.

309
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:19,515
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.

310
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,188
They dreamt of the day...

311
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:26,776
...when the Dwarves of Erebor
would reclaim their homeland.

312
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:30,655
There is no choice, Balin.

313
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:34,618
Not for me.

314
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,913
Then we are with you, laddie.

315
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:43,835
We will see it done.

316
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:06,149
Far over

317
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,150
HUMMING<br /><i>The misty mountains cold</i>

318
00:27:11,614 --> 00:27:16,117
<i>To dungeons deep</i>

319
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:20,789
<i>And caverns old</i>

320
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,502
<i>We must away</i>

321
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:30,465
<i>'Ere break of day</i>

322
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:34,219
<i>To find our</i>

323
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,182
<i>Long-forgotten gold</i>

324
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:42,936
<i>The pines were roaring</i>

325
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:47,937
<i>On the height</i>

326
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:49,234
<i>The winds</i>

327
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:52,195
<i>Were moaning</i>

328
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:57,196
<i>In the night</i>

329
00:27:57,201 --> 00:28:01,663
<i>The fire was red</i>

330
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:06,418
<i>It flaming spread</i>

331
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,255
<i>The trees like torches</i>

332
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:15,256
<i>Blazed With light</i>
