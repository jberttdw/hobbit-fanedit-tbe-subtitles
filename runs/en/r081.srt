1
02:29:40,137 --> 02:29:41,298
You all right?

2
02:29:41,537 --> 02:29:42,823
I can manage.

3
02:29:43,577 --> 02:29:45,181
Let's just get out of here.

4
02:29:59,177 --> 02:30:00,064
Run!

5
02:30:00,297 --> 02:30:01,423
Quickly! Move now!

6
02:30:15,577 --> 02:30:16,783
Get off me! Get off!

7
02:30:17,017 --> 02:30:18,621
Move them along here.

8
02:30:19,737 --> 02:30:20,738
Move on!

9
02:30:29,377 --> 02:30:30,867
What is the meaning of this?

10
02:30:31,857 --> 02:30:34,224
We caught them stealing weapons, sire.

11
02:30:34,417 --> 02:30:36,738
Enemies of the state?

12
02:30:36,977 --> 02:30:37,898
A desperate bunch of...

13
02:30:38,017 --> 02:30:40,179
mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.

14
02:30:40,417 --> 02:30:41,657
Hold your tongue!

15
02:30:44,257 --> 02:30:46,339
You do not know to whom you speak.

16
02:30:46,937 --> 02:30:48,826
This is no common criminal.

17
02:30:49,097 --> 02:30:50,462
This is Thorin...

18
02:30:50,697 --> 02:30:53,826
son of Thrain, son of Thror!

19
02:30:56,977 --> 02:30:59,059
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

20
02:31:01,777 --> 02:31:04,940
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

21
02:31:09,657 --> 02:31:12,661
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

22
02:31:13,977 --> 02:31:16,025
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

23
02:31:16,257 --> 02:31:17,668
filled with silks and fine gems.

24
02:31:19,057 --> 02:31:21,264
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

25
02:31:22,297 --> 02:31:24,982
This was the center of all trade
in the North!

26
02:31:26,817 --> 02:31:27,386
I would...

27
02:31:27,657 --> 02:31:28,863
see those days return.

28
02:31:29,097 --> 02:31:31,623
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...

29
02:31:31,857 --> 02:31:33,017
and send wealth and riches...

30
02:31:33,057 --> 02:31:35,537
flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!

31
02:31:38,537 --> 02:31:39,106
Death!

32
02:31:40,337 --> 02:31:42,863
That is what you will...
...bring upon us!

33
02:31:43,737 --> 02:31:45,421
Dragon fire and ruin.

34
02:31:47,897 --> 02:31:49,786
If you waken that beast...

35
02:31:50,417 --> 02:31:52,021
it will destroy us all.

36
02:31:52,257 --> 02:31:54,100
You can listen to this naysayer...

37
02:31:54,337 --> 02:31:55,987
but I promise you this:

38
02:31:58,377 --> 02:31:59,822
If we succeed...

39
02:32:01,177 --> 02:32:03,703
all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.

40
02:32:08,097 --> 02:32:11,146
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...

41
02:32:11,417 --> 02:32:12,623
10 times over!
