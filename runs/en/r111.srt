1
03:14:53,209 --> 03:14:55,794
- These children are starving.
- We need food.

2
03:14:56,046 --> 03:14:58,212
- We won't last three days.
- Bard...

3
03:14:58,464 --> 03:15:00,966
- ...we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.

4
03:15:02,301 --> 03:15:04,261
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

5
03:15:04,803 --> 03:15:06,471
We need more water.

6
03:15:06,723 --> 03:15:09,058
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.

7
03:15:09,308 --> 03:15:10,475
Here you are.

8
03:15:11,435 --> 03:15:12,435
Good morning, Alfrid.

9
03:15:13,395 --> 03:15:14,897
What news from the night watch?

10
03:15:15,147 --> 03:15:17,691
All quiet, sire. Not much to report.

11
03:15:18,234 --> 03:15:20,109
Nothing gets past me.

12
03:15:27,201 --> 03:15:30,287
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.
