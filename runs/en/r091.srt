1
02:56:35,755 --> 02:56:36,836
What about Bilbo?

2
02:56:37,075 --> 02:56:38,076
Give him more time.

3
02:56:38,315 --> 02:56:40,477
Time to do what? To be killed?

4
02:56:42,955 --> 02:56:44,195
You're afraid.

5
02:56:45,875 --> 02:56:48,162
Yes, I'm afraid.

6
02:56:49,315 --> 02:56:50,680
I fear for you.

7
02:56:52,035 --> 02:56:54,197
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

8
02:56:54,635 --> 02:56:55,650
A sickness which drove...

9
02:56:55,675 --> 02:56:56,961
your grandfather mad.

10
02:56:57,235 --> 02:56:58,805
I am not my grandfather.

11
02:56:59,035 --> 02:57:00,799
You're not yourself.

12
02:57:01,675 --> 02:57:03,803
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...

13
02:57:04,075 --> 02:57:04,795
I will not risk...

14
02:57:04,875 --> 02:57:08,675
this quest for the life of one burglar.

15
02:57:10,555 --> 02:57:12,000
Bilbo.

16
02:57:12,355 --> 02:57:14,278
His name is Bilbo.
