1
03:16:03,799 --> 03:16:06,091
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...

2
03:16:06,344 --> 03:16:08,719
- ...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.

3
03:16:27,614 --> 03:16:28,781
Here you go.

4
03:16:30,033 --> 03:16:31,241
Pass it back.

5
03:16:32,118 --> 03:16:33,243
Another one.

6
03:16:37,290 --> 03:16:38,290
You have saved us.

7
03:16:39,042 --> 03:16:40,502
I do not know how to thank you.

8
03:16:40,752 --> 03:16:42,587
Your gratitude is misplaced.

9
03:16:43,422 --> 03:16:45,382
I did not come on your behalf.

10
03:16:45,632 --> 03:16:48,509
I came to reclaim something of mine.

11
03:16:55,725 --> 03:16:59,187
There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.

12
03:16:59,980 --> 03:17:03,065
White gems of pure starlight.

13
03:17:03,817 --> 03:17:06,194
The White Gems of Lasgalen.

14
03:17:08,114 --> 03:17:11,074
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.

15
03:17:17,038 --> 03:17:18,665
Wait! Please wait!

16
03:17:22,127 --> 03:17:24,545
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?

17
03:17:24,797 --> 03:17:28,382
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

18
03:17:28,634 --> 03:17:30,134
We are allies in this.

19
03:17:31,636 --> 03:17:32,386
My people...

20
03:17:32,638 --> 03:17:35,348
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.

21
03:17:35,891 --> 03:17:36,641
Let me...

22
03:17:36,891 --> 03:17:38,143
...speak with Thorin.

23
03:17:38,726 --> 03:17:41,145
You would try to reason with the Dwarf?

24
03:17:41,397 --> 03:17:42,730
To avoid war?

25
03:17:43,565 --> 03:17:44,607
Yes.

26
03:17:45,484 --> 03:17:47,402
Not a bad night's work.

27
03:17:49,487 --> 03:17:50,737
Come on.

28
03:18:13,429 --> 03:18:16,013
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.

29
03:18:16,265 --> 03:18:18,766
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

30
03:18:19,018 --> 03:18:20,476
Why do you come to the gates...

31
03:18:20,728 --> 03:18:23,187
...of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?

32
03:18:23,438 --> 03:18:26,315
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...

33
03:18:27,025 --> 03:18:29,359
...like a robber in his hold?

34
03:18:30,029 --> 03:18:33,114
Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.

35
03:18:34,158 --> 03:18:35,199
My lord...

36
03:18:36,076 --> 03:18:38,036
...we have not come to rob you...

37
03:18:38,286 --> 03:18:40,538
...but to seek fair settlement.

38
03:18:41,165 --> 03:18:43,082
Will you not speak with me?

39
03:19:18,118 --> 03:19:19,451
I am listening.

40
03:19:20,538 --> 03:19:22,371
On behalf of the people of Lake-town...

41
03:19:22,623 --> 03:19:24,665
...I ask that you honor your pledge.

42
03:19:25,292 --> 03:19:26,583
A share of the treasure...

43
03:19:26,835 --> 03:19:28,835
...so that they might rebuild their lives.

44
03:19:29,754 --> 03:19:32,047
I will not treat with any man...

45
03:19:32,591 --> 03:19:35,051
...while an armed host lies before my door.

46
03:19:35,301 --> 03:19:38,971
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.

47
03:19:40,266 --> 03:19:43,016
And your threats do not sway me.

48
03:19:44,853 --> 03:19:46,312
What of your conscience?

49
03:19:46,897 --> 03:19:49,732
Does it not tell you our cause is just?

50
03:19:51,109 --> 03:19:53,652
My people offered you help.

51
03:19:55,656 --> 03:19:59,241
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

52
03:19:59,493 --> 03:20:02,703
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?

53
03:20:02,955 --> 03:20:04,246
A bargain was struck!

54
03:20:04,498 --> 03:20:05,707
A bargain?

55
03:20:05,958 --> 03:20:08,835
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright...

56
03:20:09,085 --> 03:20:10,877
...for blankets and food?
To ransom...

57
03:20:11,129 --> 03:20:13,339
...our future in exchange
for our freedom?

58
03:20:14,174 --> 03:20:16,384
You call that a fair trade?

59
03:20:18,511 --> 03:20:19,846
Tell me...
