1
02:26:35,791 --> 02:26:38,158
Da! Where have you been?

2
02:26:38,431 --> 02:26:41,401
Father! There you are! I was worried.

3
02:26:41,751 --> 02:26:43,162
Here, Sigrid.

4
02:26:43,711 --> 02:26:44,678
Bain, get them in.

5
02:26:52,431 --> 02:26:55,037
If you speak of this to anyone...

6
02:26:55,271 --> 02:26:56,716
I'll rip your arms off.

7
02:26:59,591 --> 02:27:01,081
Get off.

8
02:27:02,511 --> 02:27:03,592
Up there.

9
02:27:11,351 --> 02:27:12,159
Da...

10
02:27:12,431 --> 02:27:14,672
why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

11
02:27:14,911 --> 02:27:16,242
Will they bring us luck?

12
02:27:20,831 --> 02:27:21,673
They may not be the best fit...

13
02:27:21,911 --> 02:27:23,675
but they'll keep you warm.

14
02:27:24,351 --> 02:27:25,398
Thank you very much.

15
02:27:35,591 --> 02:27:37,673
A Dwarvish windlance.

16
02:27:37,991 --> 02:27:40,117
You look like...
...you've seen a ghost.

17
02:27:40,871 --> 02:27:42,032
He has.

18
02:27:42,831 --> 02:27:45,755
The last time we saw...
...such a weapon...

19
02:27:46,791 --> 02:27:47,678
a city was on fire.

20
02:27:49,711 --> 02:27:51,952
It was the day the dragon came.

21
02:27:55,191 --> 02:27:56,681
<i>The day that Smaug...</i>

22
02:27:56,911 --> 02:27:58,037
<i>destroyed Dale.</i>

23
02:28:00,511 --> 02:28:02,718
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

24
02:28:02,951 --> 02:28:03,926
<i>rallied his bowmen...</i>

25
02:28:03,951 --> 02:28:05,077
<i>to fire upon the beast.</i>

26
02:28:06,231 --> 02:28:07,960
But a dragon's hide is tough.

27
02:28:08,551 --> 02:28:10,713
Tougher than the strongest armor.

28
02:28:10,951 --> 02:28:14,160
Only a Black Arrow fired
from a windlance...

29
02:28:14,391 --> 02:28:15,995
could have pierced the dragon's hide.

30
02:28:16,951 --> 02:28:17,998
<i>And few of those...</i>

31
02:28:18,231 --> 02:28:20,040
<i>arrows were ever made.</i>

32
02:28:25,351 --> 02:28:26,477
<i>The store was running low...</i>

33
02:28:26,991 --> 02:28:27,672
<i>when Girion...</i>

34
02:28:27,831 --> 02:28:28,752
<i>made his last stand.</i>

35
02:28:36,791 --> 02:28:40,193
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

36
02:28:40,791 --> 02:28:42,634
much would have been different.

37
02:28:46,751 --> 02:28:48,674
You speak as if you were there.

38
02:28:50,031 --> 02:28:52,159
All Dwarves know the tale.

39
02:28:52,471 --> 02:28:54,678
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

40
02:28:54,911 --> 02:28:56,800
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

41
02:28:57,071 --> 02:28:58,991
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.

42
02:29:00,271 --> 02:29:02,160
That's a fairy story, lad.

43
02:29:02,391 --> 02:29:03,802
Nothing more.

44
02:29:04,791 --> 02:29:06,156
You took our money.

45
02:29:07,231 --> 02:29:08,517
Where are the weapons?
