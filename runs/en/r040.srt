1
01:21:34,826 --> 01:21:39,747
Too many boneses, precious.
Not enough flesh!

2
01:21:39,748 --> 01:21:44,126
Shut up! Cut its skin off.

3
01:21:44,127 --> 01:21:46,796
Start with its head.

4
01:21:51,468 --> 01:21:55,429
<i>The cold hard lands
They bites our hands</i>

5
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:58,933
<i>They gnaws our feet</i>

6
01:21:58,934 --> 01:22:03,604
<i>The rocks and stones
They're like old bones</i>

7
01:22:03,605 --> 01:22:06,023
<i>All bare of meat</i>

8
01:22:06,024 --> 01:22:09,819
<i>Cold as death
Without no breath</i>

9
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,570
<i>It's good to eat</i>

10
01:22:50,152 --> 01:22:52,695
Bless us and splash us...

11
01:22:52,696 --> 01:22:54,572
...precious.

12
01:22:54,573 --> 01:22:58,325
That's a meaty mouthful.

13
01:22:58,326 --> 01:23:02,288
Gollum, gollum! Aah.

14
01:23:02,289 --> 01:23:04,832
Back. Stay back.

15
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:06,792
I'm warning you...

16
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:10,129
...don't come any closer.

17
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,464
It's got an Elfish blade.

18
01:23:12,465 --> 01:23:16,093
But it's not an Elfs.

19
01:23:16,094 --> 01:23:18,470
Not an Elfs, no.

20
01:23:18,471 --> 01:23:21,307
What is it, precious?

21
01:23:21,308 --> 01:23:22,933
What is it?

22
01:23:22,934 --> 01:23:27,313
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

23
01:23:27,314 --> 01:23:29,940
Bagginses?

24
01:23:29,941 --> 01:23:33,944
What is a Bagginses, precious?

25
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:38,157
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
- Oh.

26
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:43,158
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes.
But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.

27
01:23:44,706 --> 01:23:47,875
Is it soft? Is it juicy?

28
01:23:47,876 --> 01:23:49,251
Now, now...

29
01:23:49,252 --> 01:23:51,629
...keep your distance!

30
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:53,756
I'll use this if I have to.

31
01:23:53,757 --> 01:23:54,882
Aah!

32
01:23:54,883 --> 01:23:56,258
I don't want any trouble.

33
01:23:56,259 --> 01:23:57,927
Do you understand?

34
01:23:57,928 --> 01:24:01,180
Just show me the way to get out of here
and I'll be on my way.

35
01:24:01,181 --> 01:24:03,265
Why? Is it lost?

36
01:24:03,266 --> 01:24:07,269
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost
as soon as possible.

37
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:11,023
Ooh, we knows!
We knows safe paths for Hobbitses.

38
01:24:11,024 --> 01:24:12,149
Safe paths in...

39
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:13,817
...the dark. Shut up!

40
01:24:13,818 --> 01:24:15,069
I didn't say anything.

41
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:17,279
We wasn't talking to you.

42
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,366
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.

43
01:24:20,367 --> 01:24:22,826

...but I--

45
01:24:23,745 --> 01:24:25,454

46
01:24:25,455 --> 01:24:28,457
Oh, we love games,

47
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:30,918
Does it like games? Does it, does it?

48
01:24:30,919 --> 01:24:33,504
Does it like to play?

49
01:24:33,505 --> 01:24:37,049
Maybe.

50
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:41,845
<i>What has roots as nobody sees?</i>

51
01:24:41,846 --> 01:24:44,765
<i>ls taller than trees?</i>

52
01:24:44,766 --> 01:24:47,017

01:24:51,898 --> 01:24:53,732
Yes, yes.

57
01:24:53,733 --> 01:24:57,111
Oh, let's have another one, eh?

58
01:24:57,112 --> 01:24:59,113
Yes! Do it again.

59
01:24:59,114 --> 01:25:00,698
Do it again. Ask us.

60
01:25:00,699 --> 01:25:04,076
No! No more riddles.

61

01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:14,044
No. I want to play. I do.

65
01:25:14,045 --> 01:25:16,839
I want to play. I can see...

66
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,176
...you are very good at this.

So why don't we...

Yes. Yes.

75
01:25:44,075 --> 01:25:45,492
And if it loses?

76
01:25:45,493 --> 01:25:47,369
What then?

77
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:52,041
Well, if it loses, precious,
then we eats it.

78
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:57,042
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

79
01:26:02,218 --> 01:26:07,218
Fair enough.

80
01:26:08,141 --> 01:26:13,141
Well, Baggins first.

81
01:26:16,441 --> 01:26:19,735

<i>Then they stamp</i>

84
01:26:22,781 --> 01:26:27,781
<i>Then they stand still</i>

85
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:37,586
Teeth?

86
01:26:37,587 --> 01:26:38,921
Teeth!

87
01:26:38,922 --> 01:26:42,091
Oh, Yes, my precious!

88
01:26:42,092 --> 01:26:45,052
But we-- We...

89
01:26:45,053 --> 01:26:50,053
...only have nine.

90
01:26:51,184 --> 01:26:54,311
Our turn.

91

100
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:21,292
Shut up!

101
01:27:23,842 --> 01:27:25,342
Wind.

102
01:27:25,343 --> 01:27:26,677
It's wind.

103
01:27:26,678 --> 01:27:28,053
Of course it is.

104
01:27:28,054 --> 01:27:29,805
Very clever...

105
01:27:29,806 --> 01:27:31,974
...Hobbitses.

106
01:27:31,975 --> 01:27:33,434
Very clever.

107
01:27:33,435 --> 01:27:34,560
Ah-ah-ah.

108
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:36,520
<i>A box without hinges</i>

Oh, um...

01:27:49,993 --> 01:27:52,327
Box. The lid and a key.

115
01:27:52,328 --> 01:27:53,620
Well?

116
01:27:53,621 --> 01:27:57,666
It's nasty.

117
01:27:57,667 --> 01:27:59,418
Box. Key.

118
01:27:59,419 --> 01:28:00,377
Do you give up?

119
01:28:00,378 --> 01:28:05,378
Give us a chance, precious!
Give us a chance!

120
01:28:16,644 --> 01:28:18,479
Eggses!

Give me a moment, please.
I gave you a good long while.

136
01:29:06,528 --> 01:29:10,322
Birds, beasts... Beasts?
Trees, flowers.

137
01:29:10,323 --> 01:29:11,907
I don't know this one.

138
01:29:11,908 --> 01:29:15,285
Is it tasty?

139
01:29:15,286 --> 01:29:19,831
Is it scrumptious?

140
01:29:19,832 --> 01:29:21,667
Is it crunchable?

141
01:29:21,668 --> 01:29:23,168
Let me think.

142
01:29:23,169 --> 01:29:28,169
Let me think.

Time's up.

Time.

147
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:49,278
The answer...

148
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:50,779
...is time.

149
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:56,577
Actually it wasn't that hard.

150
01:29:56,578 --> 01:29:59,580
Last question.

151
01:29:59,581 --> 01:30:01,540
Last chance.

152
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:05,752
Okay.

153
01:30:05,753 --> 01:30:08,964
Ask us.

154
01:30:08,965 --> 01:30:09,881

Yes, yes. All right.

156

What have I got...

157

...in my pocket?

158
01:30:23,146 --> 01:30:25,897
That's no fair.

159
01:30:25,898 --> 01:30:28,066
It's not fair! It's against...

160
01:30:28,067 --> 01:30:30,986
...the rules!

161
01:30:30,987 --> 01:30:32,821
Now ask us another one.

162
01:30:32,822 --> 01:30:34,364
No. No, no, no.

163
01:30:34,365 --> 01:30:38,493
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.

...three!

167
01:30:46,044 --> 01:30:48,503
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.

168
01:30:48,504 --> 01:30:50,589
- Handses!
- Wrong.

169
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:51,798
Guess again.

170
01:30:53,051 --> 01:30:57,304
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...

171
01:30:59,682 --> 01:31:02,017
Knife! Oh, shut up!

172
01:31:02,018 --> 01:31:03,977
Wrong again. Last guess.

173
01:31:03,978 --> 01:31:05,812
String.

174
01:31:05,813 --> 01:31:07,272
Or nothing.

175
01:31:07,273 --> 01:31:12,152
Two guesses at once.
Wrong both times.

01:31:17,116 --> 01:31:18,950
Come, then. I won the game.

You promised to show me the way out.

179
01:31:21,329 --> 01:31:24,414
Did we say so, precious?

180
01:31:24,415 --> 01:31:29,415
Did we say so?

181
01:31:30,588 --> 01:31:35,588
What has it got in its pocketses?

182
01:31:36,386 --> 01:31:38,679
That's no concern of yours.

183
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,931
You lost.

184
01:31:40,932 --> 01:31:44,643

01:32:06,249 --> 01:32:07,165
No!

192
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:10,335
No!

193
01:32:10,336 --> 01:32:12,170
Lost!

194
01:32:12,171 --> 01:32:14,840
Curse us and splash us!

195
01:32:14,841 --> 01:32:16,842
My precious...

196
01:32:16,843 --> 01:32:20,137
...is lost!

197
01:32:20,138 --> 01:32:21,263
What have you lost?

198
01:32:21,264 --> 01:32:24,808
Mustn't ask us! Not its business!

199
01:32:24,809 --> 01:32:27,602
No! Gollum!

200
01:32:27,603 --> 01:32:30,397
Gollum!

201
01:32:42,034 --> 01:32:45,787
What has it got...

202
01:32:45,788 --> 01:32:48,665
...in its nasty...

203
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:53,666
...little pocketses?

204
01:33:01,387 --> 01:33:05,348
He stole it.

205
01:33:05,349 --> 01:33:09,060
He stole it!

206
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:15,980
He stole it!
