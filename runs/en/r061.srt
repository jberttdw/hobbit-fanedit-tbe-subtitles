1
01:54:29,751 --> 01:54:31,674
I would not venture there...

2
01:54:31,911 --> 01:54:33,754
except in great need.

3
01:54:33,991 --> 01:54:35,993
We will take the Elven Road.

4
01:54:36,271 --> 01:54:37,238
That path is still safe.

5
01:54:37,471 --> 01:54:38,552
"Safe"?

6
01:54:39,071 --> 01:54:40,402
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...

7
01:54:40,631 --> 01:54:41,671
are not like their kin.

8
01:54:42,231 --> 01:54:43,676
They're less wise...

9
01:54:43,951 --> 01:54:45,840
and more dangerous.

10
01:54:47,271 --> 01:54:48,875
But it matters not.

11
01:54:50,791 --> 01:54:51,872
What do you mean?

12
01:54:52,111 --> 01:54:54,876
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

13
01:54:55,631 --> 01:54:58,316
Their numbers are growing.

14
01:54:58,591 --> 01:55:00,036
And you are on foot.

15
01:55:00,951 --> 01:55:01,918
You will never reach...

16
01:55:02,151 --> 01:55:04,199
the forest alive.

17
01:55:08,671 --> 01:55:10,992
I don't like Dwarves.

18
01:55:11,991 --> 01:55:13,675
They're greedy...

19
01:55:14,391 --> 01:55:15,392
and blind.

20
01:55:16,871 --> 01:55:18,760
Blind to the lives of those they deem...

21
01:55:19,031 --> 01:55:21,477
lesser than their own.

22
01:55:28,111 --> 01:55:30,352
But Orcs I hate more.

23
01:55:32,191 --> 01:55:33,841
What do you need?
