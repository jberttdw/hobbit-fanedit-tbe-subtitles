1
03:37:53,526 --> 03:37:55,194
Ironfoot.

2
03:38:15,339 --> 03:38:17,674
Hey, Thorin!

3
03:38:18,092 --> 03:38:19,510
Ironfoot has come!

4
03:38:26,685 --> 03:38:27,810
Who is that?

5
03:38:28,352 --> 03:38:29,602
He doesn't look very happy.

6
03:38:29,855 --> 03:38:32,605
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills.

7
03:38:32,857 --> 03:38:33,857
Thorin's...

8
03:38:33,941 --> 03:38:35,567
- ...cousin.
- Are they alike?

9
03:38:36,653 --> 03:38:40,280
I've always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.

10
03:38:50,542 --> 03:38:51,667
Good morning.

11
03:38:51,918 --> 03:38:53,461
How are we all?

12
03:38:57,048 --> 03:38:58,423
I have a wee proposition...

13
03:38:58,674 --> 03:39:00,967
...if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments...

14
03:39:01,218 --> 03:39:02,470
...of your time.

15
03:39:03,722 --> 03:39:05,765
Would you consider...

16
03:39:07,767 --> 03:39:09,017
...just sodding off?

17
03:39:10,352 --> 03:39:11,352
All of you!

18
03:39:11,605 --> 03:39:13,064
Right now!

19
03:39:13,315 --> 03:39:14,315
Stand fast.

20
03:39:16,067 --> 03:39:17,317
Come now, Lord Dain.

21
03:39:18,278 --> 03:39:19,861
Gandalf the Grey.

22
03:39:21,781 --> 03:39:22,906
Tell this rabble...

23
03:39:23,158 --> 03:39:24,991
...to leave, or I'll water...

24
03:39:25,243 --> 03:39:26,910
...the ground with their blood!

25
03:39:30,414 --> 03:39:31,539
No need for war...

26
03:39:31,792 --> 03:39:34,459
...between Dwarves, Men and Elves.

27
03:39:34,711 --> 03:39:35,711
A legion of Orcs...

28
03:39:35,962 --> 03:39:37,504
...march on the Mountain.

29
03:39:37,756 --> 03:39:38,463
Stand down.

30
03:39:38,714 --> 03:39:41,758
I will not stand down before any Elf.

31
03:39:42,468 --> 03:39:45,471
Not least this faithless Woodland sprite.

32
03:39:46,472 --> 03:39:49,516
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people.

33
03:39:50,601 --> 03:39:51,601
If he chooses...

34
03:39:51,852 --> 03:39:54,521
...to stand between me and my kin...

35
03:39:55,815 --> 03:39:57,690
...I'll split his pretty head open!

36
03:40:00,028 --> 03:40:01,861
See if he's still smirking then.

37
03:40:04,074 --> 03:40:04,739
Dain...

38
03:40:04,990 --> 03:40:05,990
...wait!

39
03:40:11,373 --> 03:40:12,373
Let them advance.

40
03:40:12,540 --> 03:40:14,374
See how far they get.

41
03:40:14,625 --> 03:40:16,877
You think I give a dead dog
for your threats...

42
03:40:17,128 --> 03:40:18,838
...you pointy-eared...

43
03:40:19,088 --> 03:40:20,506
...princess?

44
03:40:21,842 --> 03:40:23,967
You hear that, lads? We're on!

45
03:40:24,261 --> 03:40:26,887
Let's give these bastards
a good hammering!

46
03:40:31,642 --> 03:40:32,810
Stand your men down.

47
03:40:33,061 --> 03:40:35,436
I'll deal with Ironfoot and his rabble.

48
03:40:41,610 --> 03:40:42,235
Right then.

49
03:40:42,486 --> 03:40:44,320
Let's get this done.

50
03:40:45,281 --> 03:40:46,906
Send in the goats.
