1
01:13:51,389 --> 01:13:52,305
Where do you think...

2
01:13:52,306 --> 01:13:56,601
---You're going?

3
01:13:56,602 --> 01:13:59,062
Back to Rivendell.

4
01:13:59,063 --> 01:14:01,565
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

5
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:03,066
You're part of the company.

6
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:04,693
You're one of us.

7
01:14:04,694 --> 01:14:07,821
I'm not, though, am I?

8
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:11,324
Thorin said I should never have come
and he was right.

9
01:14:11,325 --> 01:14:12,367
I'm not a Took...

10
01:14:12,368 --> 01:14:16,705
...I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.

11
01:14:16,706 --> 01:14:18,623
I should never have run out my door.

12
01:14:18,624 --> 01:14:21,042
You're homesick. I understand.

13
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:23,712
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.

14
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:26,590
You're Dwarves.
You're used to this life.

15
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:28,049
To living on the road...

16
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:33,050
...never settling in one place,
not belonging anywhere!

17
01:14:34,473 --> 01:14:36,182
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't--

18
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:46,689
No, you're right.

19
01:14:46,694 --> 01:14:51,694
We don't belong anywhere.

20
01:14:56,913 --> 01:15:01,913
I wish you all the luck in the world.

21
01:15:02,418 --> 01:15:07,418
I really do.

22
01:15:08,257 --> 01:15:11,885
What's that?

23
01:15:11,886 --> 01:15:16,886
BI
Hmm?

24
01:15:32,114 --> 01:15:33,406
Wake up!

25
01:15:33,407 --> 01:15:34,449
Wake up!

26
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,700
Whoa!

27
01:15:58,099 --> 01:16:02,978
Look out! Look out!

28
01:16:02,979 --> 01:16:03,895
Get away!

29
01:16:08,693 --> 01:16:10,360
Filthy scum!

30
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:15,361
Get back!

31
01:16:16,325 --> 01:16:21,325
You'll pay for this!

32
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:27,419
Got you.

33
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:31,172
All right, all right.

34
01:16:31,173 --> 01:16:36,173
Get off! Get your hands off me!
Get off me!

35
01:16:39,557 --> 01:16:44,557
Get off me!
