1
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,190
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

2
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:08,282
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

3
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:10,450
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

4
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:17,374
What was that?

5
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,126
<i>Orcs.</i>

6
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:21,837
Orcs?

7
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:22,879
Throat-cutters.

8
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,965
There'll be dozens of them out there.

9
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,008
The lone-lands...

10
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:28,176
...are crawling with them.
KILI: They strike...

11
00:34:28,177 --> 00:34:32,222
...in the wee small hours when everyone's
asleep. Quick and quiet, no screams.

12
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:36,768
Just lots of blood.

13
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:41,606
You think that's funny?

14
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,776
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?

15
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:47,404
We didn't mean anything by it.

16
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:49,489
No, you didn't.

17
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:53,452
You know nothing of the world.

18
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:55,871
Don't mind him, laddie.

19
00:34:55,872 --> 00:35:00,872
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.

20
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:08,633
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain...

21
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:09,926
...King Thror...

22
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:14,927
...tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

23
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:21,309
<i>But our enemy had got there first.</i>

24
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:36,661
<i>Moria had been taken by legions of Ores...</i>

25
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,747
<i>...led by the most vile...</i>

26
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:41,333
<i>...of all their race:</i>

27
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:43,752
<i>Azog...</i>

28
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:46,755
<i>...the Defiler.</i>

29
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:49,925
<i>The giant Gundabad Orc...</i>

30
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:54,926
...had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.

31
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:01,937
He began...

32
00:36:01,938 --> 00:36:04,022
...by beheading the king.

33
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:19,287
No!

34
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:21,540
Thrain, Thorin's father...

35
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,334
...was driven mad by grief.

36
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:27,546
He went missing. Taken prisoner or killed...

37
00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:30,465
...we did not know.

38
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,717
We were leaderless.

39
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:36,471
<i>Defeat and death...</i>

40
00:36:36,472 --> 00:36:41,226
<i>...were upon us.</i>

41
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:46,227
That is when I saw him.

42
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:49,985
A young Dwarf prince...

43
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:51,611
<i>...facing down...</i>

44
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:56,612
<i>...the pale Orc.</i>

45
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:59,411
<i>He stood alone...</i>

46
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:01,705
<i>...against this terrible foe.</i>

47
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:13,049
<i>His armor rent...</i>

48
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,009
...wielding nothing...

49
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,760
<i>...but an oaken branch...</i>

50
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:20,761
<i>...as a shield.</i>

51
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:30,567
<i>Azog...</i>

52
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:34,821
<i>...the Defiler learned that day...</i>

53
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:39,822
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

54
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,524
<i>Our forces rallied...</i>

55
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:14,194
<i>...and drove the Orcs back.</i>

56
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:16,321
<i>And our enemy...</i>

57
00:38:16,322 --> 00:38:19,783
<i>...had been defeated.</i>

58
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:22,827
But there was no feast...

59
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:25,789
...nor song that night...

60
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:30,790
<i>...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.</i>

61
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:36,629
<i>We few had survived.</i>

62
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:47,139
<i>And I thought to myself then...</i>

63
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:52,812
<i>...there is one who I could follow.</i>

64
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:57,195
There is one...

65
00:38:57,196 --> 00:39:02,196
...I could call king.

66
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:21,845
And the pale Orc?

67
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:23,513
What happened to him?

68
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:27,475
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.

69
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:32,476
That filth died of his wounds long ago.
