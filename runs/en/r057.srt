1
01:49:31,252 --> 01:49:32,458
Bilbo.

2
01:49:32,732 --> 01:49:33,494
There you are.

3
01:49:33,772 --> 01:49:34,375
Now...

4
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:37,622
this will require
some delicate handling.

5
01:49:37,852 --> 01:49:39,900
We must tread very carefully.

6
01:49:40,132 --> 01:49:44,137
The last person to have startled him
was torn to shreds.

7
01:49:46,452 --> 01:49:48,772
I will go first and... Bilbo?

8
01:49:49,012 --> 01:49:50,741
You come with me.

9
01:49:52,012 --> 01:49:54,618
- Is this a good idea?
- Yes.

10
01:49:54,852 --> 01:49:57,139
Now, the rest of you, you just wait here...

11
01:49:57,372 --> 01:49:58,646
and don't come out
until I give the signal.

12
01:49:58,659 --> 01:49:59,943
Right.

13
01:50:00,172 --> 01:50:01,412
Wait for the signal.

14
01:50:01,652 --> 01:50:04,974
And no sudden moves or loud noises,
and don't overcrowd him.

15
01:50:05,212 --> 01:50:07,533
And only come out in pairs. Right.

16
01:50:07,812 --> 01:50:09,337
No, actually, Bombur...

17
01:50:10,892 --> 01:50:12,974
um, you count as two
so you should come out alone.

18
01:50:15,452 --> 01:50:18,058
Remember, wait for the signal.

19
01:50:18,292 --> 01:50:20,977
The signal. Right.

20
01:50:21,212 --> 01:50:22,252
What signal would that be?

21
01:50:38,292 --> 01:50:39,532
- Ahem.
- You're nervous.

22
01:50:43,812 --> 01:50:47,021
Nervous? What nonsense.

23
01:50:47,492 --> 01:50:48,414
Good morning.

24
01:50:55,012 --> 01:50:56,821
Good morning!

25
01:50:59,652 --> 01:51:01,097
Who are you?

26
01:51:01,332 --> 01:51:05,132
I'm Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

27
01:51:09,972 --> 01:51:11,861
Never heard of him.

28
01:51:15,012 --> 01:51:16,173
I'm a Wizard.

29
01:51:16,612 --> 01:51:19,297
Perhaps you've heard of my colleague
Radagast the Brown.

30
01:51:19,532 --> 01:51:22,536
He resides in the southern borders
of Mirkwood.

31
01:51:22,772 --> 01:51:24,900
What do you want?

32
01:51:25,132 --> 01:51:28,693
Well, simply to thank you
for your hospitality.

33
01:51:28,972 --> 01:51:30,692
You may have noticed that we took refuge...

34
01:51:30,852 --> 01:51:32,616
in your lodgings here last night.

35
01:51:34,292 --> 01:51:35,812
Who is this... little fellow?

36
01:51:36,532 --> 01:51:38,739
Well, this would be Mr. Baggins...

37
01:51:38,972 --> 01:51:40,019
from the Shire.

38
01:51:42,092 --> 01:51:44,413
He's not a Dwarf, is he?

39
01:51:44,892 --> 01:51:47,782
Why, no. No, he's a Hobbit.

40
01:51:48,372 --> 01:51:51,933
A good family
and unimpeachable reputation.

41
01:51:52,172 --> 01:51:55,574
A Halfling and a Wizard.

42
01:51:56,492 --> 01:51:57,732
How come you here?

43
01:51:57,972 --> 01:51:58,773
Well, the fact is...

44
01:51:58,892 --> 01:52:01,133
that we've had a bad time of it...

45
01:52:01,372 --> 01:52:04,216
from Goblins in the mountains.

46
01:52:04,452 --> 01:52:05,817
What did you go near Goblins for?

47
01:52:06,092 --> 01:52:07,582
Stupid thing to do.

48
01:52:07,852 --> 01:52:09,058
You are absolutely...

49
01:52:09,292 --> 01:52:10,373
- ...right. No, it...
- There it is. Go.

50
01:52:10,612 --> 01:52:12,899
- Go.
- ...was terrible.

51
01:52:21,892 --> 01:52:23,859
Dwalin... and Balin.

52
01:52:24,092 --> 01:52:25,298
And I must...

53
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,540
confess that, several...

54
01:52:27,772 --> 01:52:31,060
of our group are, in fact, Dwarves.

55
01:52:31,332 --> 01:52:36,173
Do you call two... "several"?

56
01:52:36,412 --> 01:52:38,983
Well, now you put it that way...

57
01:52:41,452 --> 01:52:43,779
Yes, there could be more...
...than two.

58
01:52:44,532 --> 01:52:45,215
Go, go.

59
01:52:45,652 --> 01:52:46,572
Wait, that's us.

60
01:52:50,532 --> 01:52:51,532
And here are some more...

61
01:52:51,652 --> 01:52:53,416
of our, happy troop.

62
01:52:53,652 --> 01:52:55,859
And do you call six a "troop"?

63
01:52:56,932 --> 01:52:59,333
What are you, a traveling circus?

64
01:53:00,452 --> 01:53:01,180
Go.

65
01:53:01,412 --> 01:53:02,493
Go. Go, go.

66
01:53:05,772 --> 01:53:09,219
Dori and Ori at your service.

67
01:53:09,492 --> 01:53:11,132
I don't... want your service.

68
01:53:11,372 --> 01:53:12,612
Absolutely understandable.

69
01:53:12,852 --> 01:53:13,535
Go.

70
01:53:13,772 --> 01:53:14,739
Go.

71
01:53:17,372 --> 01:53:20,216
Fili and Kili. I'd quite forgotten. Yes.

72
01:53:21,452 --> 01:53:25,661
Yes, and Nori, Bofur...
...Bifur...

73
01:53:27,132 --> 01:53:28,782
and Bombur.

74
01:53:29,932 --> 01:53:31,536
Is that it?

75
01:53:34,332 --> 01:53:35,857
Are there any more?

76
01:53:48,132 --> 01:53:51,898
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.
