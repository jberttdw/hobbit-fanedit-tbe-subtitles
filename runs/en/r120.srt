1
03:30:10,862 --> 03:30:11,862
Bowman!

2
03:30:13,115 --> 03:30:14,115
Do you agree?

3
03:30:14,367 --> 03:30:16,659
Is gold so important to you?

4
03:30:17,452 --> 03:30:19,954
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?

5
03:30:20,706 --> 03:30:21,747
It won't come to that.

6
03:30:21,999 --> 03:30:24,751
- This is a fight they cannot win.
- That won't stop them.

7
03:30:25,001 --> 03:30:27,921
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.

8
03:30:28,171 --> 03:30:29,965
They will fight to the death.

9
03:30:30,215 --> 03:30:31,675
Bilbo Baggins.

10
03:30:32,217 --> 03:30:33,467
If I'm not mistaken...

11
03:30:33,718 --> 03:30:36,137
...this is the Halfling
who stole the keys...

12
03:30:36,389 --> 03:30:38,014
...to my dungeons from under...

13
03:30:38,266 --> 03:30:40,099
...the nose of my guards.

14
03:30:42,603 --> 03:30:43,686
Yes.

15
03:30:44,688 --> 03:30:45,438
Sorry...

16
03:30:45,690 --> 03:30:46,856
...about that.

17
03:30:47,400 --> 03:30:48,400
I came...

18
03:30:50,151 --> 03:30:51,151
...to give you...

19
03:30:51,403 --> 03:30:52,403
...this.

20
03:30:57,159 --> 03:30:59,034
The Heart of the Mountain.

21
03:31:00,954 --> 03:31:02,289
The King's Jewel.

22
03:31:03,749 --> 03:31:05,749
And worth a king's ransom.

23
03:31:07,670 --> 03:31:08,420
How is this...

24
03:31:08,671 --> 03:31:09,796
...yours to give?

25
03:31:10,046 --> 03:31:12,048
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.

26
03:31:13,675 --> 03:31:14,800
Why would you do this?

27
03:31:15,052 --> 03:31:16,302
You owe us no loyalty.

28
03:31:16,554 --> 03:31:18,262
I'm not doing it for you.

29
03:31:20,099 --> 03:31:22,349
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate...

30
03:31:22,851 --> 03:31:24,144
...and pigheaded...

31
03:31:24,854 --> 03:31:25,979
...and difficult.

32
03:31:26,229 --> 03:31:28,023
They're suspicious and secretive...

33
03:31:28,273 --> 03:31:29,816
...with the worst manners...

34
03:31:30,066 --> 03:31:32,110
...imaginable,
but they are also brave...

35
03:31:32,360 --> 03:31:33,610
...and kind...

36
03:31:35,197 --> 03:31:36,530
...and loyal to a fault.

37
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:38,700
I've grown...

38
03:31:38,784 --> 03:31:41,494
...very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.

39
03:31:42,329 --> 03:31:43,371
Now, Thorin...

40
03:31:43,621 --> 03:31:45,874
...values this stone above all else.

41
03:31:46,124 --> 03:31:48,501
In exchange for its return,
he will give you...

42
03:31:48,753 --> 03:31:49,836
...what you are owed.

43
03:31:50,086 --> 03:31:51,086
There will be no need...

44
03:31:51,296 --> 03:31:52,296
...for war.

45
03:31:57,720 --> 03:31:58,720
Rest up tonight.

46
03:31:58,970 --> 03:32:01,639
- You must leave on the morrow.
- What?

47
03:32:01,891 --> 03:32:04,809
- Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.

48
03:32:05,061 --> 03:32:07,811
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not leaving the Company.

49
03:32:08,063 --> 03:32:10,065
There is no Company. Not anymore.

50
03:32:10,316 --> 03:32:12,796
Imagine what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.

51
03:32:13,026 --> 03:32:14,610
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

52
03:32:14,862 --> 03:32:16,153
Well, you should be.

53
03:32:16,738 --> 03:32:17,738
Don't underestimate...

54
03:32:17,990 --> 03:32:19,907
...the evil of gold.

55
03:32:20,159 --> 03:32:21,159
Gold over which...

56
03:32:21,409 --> 03:32:23,494
...a serpent has long brooded.

57
03:32:23,746 --> 03:32:26,289
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all...

58
03:32:26,539 --> 03:32:28,208
...who come near this Mountain.

59
03:32:29,834 --> 03:32:30,834
Almost all. Heh.
