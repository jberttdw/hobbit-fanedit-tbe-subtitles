1
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,044
What's happening?

2
02:00:15,094 --> 02:00:16,712
Keep moving.

3
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:18,172
Nori...

4
02:00:19,349 --> 02:00:20,550
why have we stopped?

5
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:21,718
The path...

6
02:00:21,768 --> 02:00:23,636
it's disappeared.

7
02:00:23,686 --> 02:00:24,929
What's going on?

8
02:00:25,438 --> 02:00:27,723
We've lost the path!

9
02:00:27,774 --> 02:00:29,058
Find it.

10
02:00:29,234 --> 02:00:32,353
All of you, look.
Look for the path!

11
02:00:41,287 --> 02:00:43,781
I don't remember this bit.

12
02:00:43,831 --> 02:00:45,658
None of it's familiar.

13
02:00:45,708 --> 02:00:47,660
It's got to be here.

14
02:00:48,169 --> 02:00:49,787
What hour is it?

15
02:00:49,837 --> 02:00:53,541
I do not know. I do not
even know what day it is.

16
02:00:53,967 --> 02:00:56,711
Is there no end
to this accursed forest?!

17
02:01:11,067 --> 02:01:12,518
Attercop.

18
02:01:40,221 --> 02:01:41,380
Look.

19
02:01:41,431 --> 02:01:43,257
A tobacco pouch.

20
02:01:43,308 --> 02:01:45,927
There's Dwarves in these woods.

21
02:01:45,977 --> 02:01:48,804
Dwarves from the Blue
Mountains, no less.

22
02:01:48,855 --> 02:01:50,723
This is exactly the same as mine.

23
02:01:50,773 --> 02:01:53,643
Because it is yours.
Do you understand?

24
02:01:53,693 --> 02:01:55,686
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

25
02:01:55,737 --> 02:01:57,980
We are not lost.
We keep heading east.

26
02:01:58,031 --> 02:02:00,858
But which way is east?
We've lost the sun.

27
02:02:00,908 --> 02:02:02,485
I thought you were the expert.

28
02:02:03,411 --> 02:02:04,612
The sun.

29
02:02:05,204 --> 02:02:07,114
We have to find...

30
02:02:07,165 --> 02:02:08,616
the sun.

31
02:02:10,251 --> 02:02:11,619
Up there.

32
02:02:11,669 --> 02:02:12,703
We need to...

33
02:02:12,754 --> 02:02:14,455
get above the canopy.

34
02:02:18,259 --> 02:02:20,378
What was that?

35
02:02:21,387 --> 02:02:24,465
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

36
02:02:26,225 --> 02:02:28,177
We're being watched.

37
02:03:16,401 --> 02:03:18,352
I can see a lake!

38
02:03:18,986 --> 02:03:21,355
And a river.

39
02:03:22,865 --> 02:03:24,692
And the Lonely Mountain.

40
02:03:24,951 --> 02:03:26,944
We're almost there!

41
02:03:28,663 --> 02:03:30,197
Can you hear me?

42
02:03:31,249 --> 02:03:33,618
I know which way to go!

43
02:03:36,754 --> 02:03:38,080
Hello?

44
02:03:47,223 --> 02:03:48,633
Hello.

45
02:04:00,486 --> 02:04:01,646
Oh, no.

46
02:04:01,696 --> 02:04:02,730
Oh, come on.

47
02:05:41,754 --> 02:05:44,582
Kill them! Kill them.

48
02:05:44,632 --> 02:05:46,876
Eat them now, while
their blood is running.

49
02:05:46,926 --> 02:05:50,629
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

50
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:51,505
Stick it again.

51
02:05:51,556 --> 02:05:53,799
Stick it again. Finish it off.

52
02:05:54,725 --> 02:05:56,677
The meat's alive and kicking!

53
02:05:56,727 --> 02:05:57,511
Kill him.

54
02:05:57,562 --> 02:05:58,512
Kill him now.

55
02:05:58,563 --> 02:06:00,347
Let us feast.

56
02:06:00,398 --> 02:06:01,807
Feast! Feast!

57
02:06:01,857 --> 02:06:04,143
Feast! Feast!

58
02:06:05,319 --> 02:06:06,937
Eat them alive!

59
02:06:06,988 --> 02:06:09,231
Feast!

60
02:06:15,413 --> 02:06:17,448
- What is it?
- What is it?

61
02:06:19,125 --> 02:06:21,535
Eat them alive!

62
02:06:24,589 --> 02:06:26,916
Fat and juicy.

63
02:06:29,802 --> 02:06:31,378
Just a...

64
02:06:31,429 --> 02:06:32,713
little taste.

65
02:06:43,190 --> 02:06:45,726
Curse it! Where is it?!
Where is it?!

66
02:06:46,903 --> 02:06:48,229
Here.

67
02:06:48,988 --> 02:06:51,106
Ah! It stings!

68
02:06:51,157 --> 02:06:52,233
It stings!

69
02:06:57,997 --> 02:06:59,490
Sting.

70
02:07:00,249 --> 02:07:01,742
That's a good name.

71
02:07:03,336 --> 02:07:04,662
Sting.

72
02:07:22,897 --> 02:07:24,765
You all right there, Bofur?

73
02:07:24,941 --> 02:07:26,350
- I'm all right!
- Get it off me!

74
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:27,685
Where's Bilbo?

75
02:07:27,735 --> 02:07:28,894
I'm up here!
