1
01:01:12,379 --> 01:01:16,674
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

2
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:18,467
A famous blade...

3
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:23,468
...forged by the High Elves
of the West, my kin.

4
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:26,600
May it serve you well.

5
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:27,643
And this...

6
01:01:27,644 --> 01:01:30,646
...is Glamdring...

7
01:01:30,647 --> 01:01:32,356
...the Foehammer. Sword...

8
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:34,692
...of the King of Gondolin.

9
01:01:34,693 --> 01:01:37,403
These were made for the Goblin Wars
of the First Age.

10
01:01:37,404 --> 01:01:38,696
I wouldn't bother, laddie.

11
01:01:38,697 --> 01:01:42,366
Swords are named
for the great deeds they do in war.

12
01:01:42,367 --> 01:01:45,119
What are you saying,
my sword hasn't seen battle?

13
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,039
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

14
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,167
More of a letter opener, really.

15
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:53,836
- How did you come by these?
- We found them...

16
01:01:53,837 --> 01:01:56,672
...in a Troll-hoard on the Great East Road...
