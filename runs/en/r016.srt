1
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:37,093
The Valley of lmladris.

2
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:41,306
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

3
00:56:41,307 --> 00:56:45,602
Rivendell.

4
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:50,603
Here lies the Last Homely House
East of the Sea.

5
00:56:51,525 --> 00:56:54,861
This was your plan all along.

6
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:57,113
To seek refuge with our enemy.

7
00:56:57,114 --> 00:57:00,617
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

8
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,744
The only ill will to be found...

9
00:57:02,745 --> 00:57:05,830
...in this valley
is that which you bring yourself.

10
00:57:05,831 --> 00:57:10,168
You think the Elves will give our quest
their blessing?

11
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:11,794
They will try to stop us.

12
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:16,795
Of course they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.

13
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:23,097
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.

14
00:57:23,098 --> 00:57:24,641
And respect.

15
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:27,310
And no small degree of charm.

16
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:32,311
<i>Which is why you will leave
the talking to me.</i>

17
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:30,331
Mithrandir.

18
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:31,374
Ah.

19
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,042
Lindir.

20
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,586
Stay sharp.

21
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,174
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

22
00:58:40,175 --> 00:58:42,593
My Lord Elrond is not here.

23
00:58:42,594 --> 00:58:45,263
Not here?

24
00:58:45,264 --> 00:58:46,723
Where is he?

25
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:06,155
Close ranks!

26
00:59:26,805 --> 00:59:28,097
Gandalf.

27
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:31,768
Lord Elrond.
