00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:59,594
Hello?

2
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:08,148
Yes.

3
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:13,149
Yes.

4
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:23,265
Here...

5
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,184
...Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

6
00:30:25,185 --> 00:30:27,770
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?

7
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:32,771
I'm going on an adventure!

8
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:39,907
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Coming here was a waste of time.

9
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:41,658
That's true enough.

10
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:44,703
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit?
A Halfling?

11
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:46,288
Whose idea was it anyway?

12
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:48,165
Wait!

13
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,416
Wait!

14
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:51,168
Whoa, whoa.

15
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:57,670
Whoa, whoa.

16
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:03,722
I signed it.

17
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:08,723
Here.

18
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,442
Everything appears...

19
00:31:15,443 --> 00:31:17,069
...to be in order.

20
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,030
Welcome, Master Baggins...

21
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:23,867
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

22
00:31:28,998 --> 00:31:30,624
Give him a pony.

23
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,417
No, no, that won't be necessary.

24
00:31:32,418 --> 00:31:34,795
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.

25
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:37,548
I've done my fair share of walking holidays,
you know?

26
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:42,549
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!

27
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:57,359
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

28
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,611
One more.
Thanks, lad.

29
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:01,363
What's that about?

30
00:32:01,364 --> 00:32:06,076
Oh, they took wagers
on whether or not you'd turn up.

31
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:10,247
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

32
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:12,040
And what did you think?

33
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:16,628
Well...

34
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:21,629
My dear fellow,
I never doubted you for a second.

35
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:30,267
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

36
00:32:31,644 --> 00:32:33,896
No, wait, wait, stop.

37
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:36,315
Stop! We have to turn around.

38
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:37,482
What on earth...

39
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:38,525
...is the matter?

40
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:42,321
- I forgot my handkerchief.
Here.

41
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:46,283
Use this.

42
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:52,785
Move on.

43
00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:59,463
<i>You'll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs. ..</i>

44
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:01,965
<i>...and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins...</i>

45
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:05,928
<i>...before we reach our journey's end.</i>

46
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:06,929
<i>You were born...</i>

47
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:11,930
<i>...to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.</i>

48
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:15,437
<i>But home is now behind you.</i>

49
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:20,438
<i>The world is ahead.</i>
