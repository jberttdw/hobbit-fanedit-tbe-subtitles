1
02:32:14,756 --> 02:32:15,917
All of you!

2
02:32:16,236 --> 02:32:17,397
Listen to me!

3
02:32:17,636 --> 02:32:18,683
You must listen!

4
02:32:18,916 --> 02:32:20,645
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?

5
02:32:22,476 --> 02:32:23,611
Have you forgotten those...

6
02:32:23,636 --> 02:32:25,684
who died in the firestorm?!

7
02:32:27,956 --> 02:32:28,878
And for what purpose?

8
02:32:30,396 --> 02:32:32,205
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

9
02:32:33,076 --> 02:32:35,078
so riven by greed, he could not...

10
02:32:35,316 --> 02:32:36,841
see beyond his own desire!

11
02:32:38,076 --> 02:32:39,680
Now, now!

12
02:32:39,996 --> 02:32:41,964
We must not, any of us...

13
02:32:42,196 --> 02:32:44,563
be too quick to lay blame.

14
02:32:45,716 --> 02:32:48,245
Let us... not
forget that it was...

15
02:32:48,476 --> 02:32:50,285
Girion, Lord of Dale...

16
02:32:50,556 --> 02:32:52,206
your ancestor...

17
02:32:52,476 --> 02:32:54,956
who failed to kill the beast!

18
02:32:57,516 --> 02:32:59,484
It's true, sire.

19
02:32:59,716 --> 02:33:00,922
We all know the story.

20
02:33:02,516 --> 02:33:04,200
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

21
02:33:04,436 --> 02:33:07,007
Each one missing its mark.

22
02:33:13,756 --> 02:33:15,042
You have no right.

23
02:33:16,716 --> 02:33:18,639
No right to enter that mountain.

24
02:33:20,356 --> 02:33:22,484
I have the only right.

25
02:33:28,836 --> 02:33:30,201
I speak to the Master...

26
02:33:30,436 --> 02:33:31,926
of the Men of the Lake.

27
02:33:32,156 --> 02:33:34,477
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

28
02:33:35,436 --> 02:33:36,403
Will you...

29
02:33:36,756 --> 02:33:40,522
share in the great wealth
of our people?

30
02:33:45,516 --> 02:33:46,961
What say you?

31
02:33:50,836 --> 02:33:53,885
I say unto you...

32
02:33:55,156 --> 02:33:56,157
Welcome!

33
02:33:56,676 --> 02:33:57,359
Welcome!

34
02:33:57,716 --> 02:33:58,683
And thrice...

35
02:33:58,956 --> 02:34:01,846
welcome... King
Under the Mountain!
