1
04:02:31,192 --> 04:02:32,736
Recall your company.

2
04:02:38,868 --> 04:02:40,701
My lord, dispatch this force...

3
04:02:40,953 --> 04:02:42,745
...to Ravenhill.
The Dwarves are about...

4
04:02:42,996 --> 04:02:43,996
...to be overrun.

5
04:02:44,039 --> 04:02:45,039
Thorin must be warned.

6
04:02:45,124 --> 04:02:47,374
By all means, warn him.

7
04:02:47,625 --> 04:02:49,960
I have spent enough Elvish blood
in defense...

8
04:02:50,212 --> 04:02:51,629
...of this accursed land. No more.

9
04:02:51,880 --> 04:02:53,338
Thranduil?

10
04:02:54,340 --> 04:02:55,340
I'll go.

11
04:02:56,218 --> 04:02:57,302
Don't be ridiculous.

12
04:02:57,553 --> 04:02:58,969
You'll never make it.

13
04:02:59,221 --> 04:03:00,221
Why not?

14
04:03:00,764 --> 04:03:03,307
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.

15
04:03:04,185 --> 04:03:05,517
No, they won't.

16
04:03:07,062 --> 04:03:08,062
They won't see me.

17
04:03:09,397 --> 04:03:11,065
It's out of the question.

18
04:03:12,066 --> 04:03:13,066
I won't allow it.

19
04:03:14,069 --> 04:03:16,487
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.
