1
03:08:22,783 --> 03:08:24,783
It is here in these halls.

2
03:08:25,035 --> 03:08:26,076
I know it.

3
03:08:26,328 --> 03:08:28,120
We have searched and searched.

4
03:08:28,372 --> 03:08:29,372
Not well enough.

5
03:08:29,538 --> 03:08:31,915
Thorin, we all would see
the stone returned.

6
03:08:32,167 --> 03:08:35,085
And yet, it is still not found!

7
03:08:37,922 --> 03:08:41,841
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

8
03:08:50,643 --> 03:08:52,395
The Arkenstone...

9
03:08:53,312 --> 03:08:55,439
...is the birthright of our people.

10
03:08:56,190 --> 03:08:59,109
It is The King's Jewel.

11
03:09:00,486 --> 03:09:01,986
Am I not the king?

12
03:09:13,332 --> 03:09:14,834
Know this:

13
03:09:18,296 --> 03:09:20,547
If anyone should find it...

14
03:09:21,383 --> 03:09:23,384
...and withhold it from me...

15
03:09:25,219 --> 03:09:27,096
...I will be avenged.

16
03:09:42,696 --> 03:09:44,238
Dragon-sickness.

17
03:09:45,739 --> 03:09:47,408
I've seen it before.

18
03:09:49,243 --> 03:09:50,660
That look.

19
03:09:51,163 --> 03:09:52,872
The terrible need.

20
03:09:54,207 --> 03:09:57,334
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.

21
03:10:00,212 --> 03:10:02,047
It sent his grandfather mad.

22
03:10:03,799 --> 03:10:05,676
Balin, if Thorin...

23
03:10:06,761 --> 03:10:08,511
...had the Arkenstone...

24
03:10:09,805 --> 03:10:10,513
...or if...

25
03:10:10,765 --> 03:10:11,765
...it was found...

26
03:10:14,310 --> 03:10:15,810
...would it help?

27
03:10:18,439 --> 03:10:22,151
That stone crowns all.

28
03:10:23,319 --> 03:10:26,196
It is the summit of this great wealth...

29
03:10:26,448 --> 03:10:27,489
...bestowing power...

30
03:10:27,741 --> 03:10:29,700
...upon he who bears it.

31
03:10:29,951 --> 03:10:31,868
Would it stay his madness?

32
03:10:33,538 --> 03:10:34,830
No, laddie.

33
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:38,709
I fear it would make him worse.

34
03:10:41,546 --> 03:10:43,254
Perhaps it is best...

35
03:10:44,381 --> 03:10:46,049
...it remains lost.

36
03:10:59,855 --> 03:11:01,147
What is that?

37
03:11:02,609 --> 03:11:04,151
In your hand.

38
03:11:04,401 --> 03:11:05,401
It's nothing.

39
03:11:05,694 --> 03:11:06,946
Show me.

40
03:11:08,614 --> 03:11:09,906
It...

41
03:11:16,872 --> 03:11:19,415
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

42
03:11:23,421 --> 03:11:25,256
You've carried it all this way?

43
03:11:25,506 --> 03:11:27,299
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.

44
03:11:27,551 --> 03:11:29,134
In Bag End.

45
03:11:31,805 --> 03:11:34,931
It's a poor prize to
take back to the Shire.

46
03:11:36,768 --> 03:11:38,102
One day, it'll grow.

47
03:11:39,895 --> 03:11:42,189
And every time I look at it, I'll remember.

48
03:11:43,567 --> 03:11:46,234
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...

49
03:11:47,319 --> 03:11:49,446
...and how lucky I am that I made it home.

50
03:11:58,707 --> 03:12:00,290
Thorin, I...

51
03:12:00,542 --> 03:12:01,792
Thorin.

52
03:12:02,042 --> 03:12:04,127
Survivors from Lake-town...

53
03:12:04,671 --> 03:12:06,547
...they're streaming into Dale.

54
03:12:07,966 --> 03:12:09,674
There's hundreds of them.

55
03:12:11,343 --> 03:12:13,303
Call everyone to the gate.

56
03:12:14,555 --> 03:12:15,680
To the gate!

57
03:12:15,931 --> 03:12:16,973
Now!

58
03:12:48,006 --> 03:12:49,256
Come on.

59
03:12:49,506 --> 03:12:50,591
- Keep moving.
- Sire!
