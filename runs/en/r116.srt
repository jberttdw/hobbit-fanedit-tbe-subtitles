1
03:26:48,746 --> 03:26:51,664
You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.

2
03:26:51,916 --> 03:26:52,956
War is coming!

3
03:26:53,209 --> 03:26:54,334
The cesspits...

4
03:26:54,584 --> 03:26:55,959
...of Dol Guldur have been...

5
03:26:56,211 --> 03:26:57,211
...emptied.

6
03:26:57,253 --> 03:26:57,961
You're all...

7
03:26:58,213 --> 03:26:59,296
...in mortal danger.

8
03:26:59,548 --> 03:27:00,840
What are you talking about?

9
03:27:02,092 --> 03:27:03,175
You know nothing...

10
03:27:03,427 --> 03:27:04,677
...of Wizards.

11
03:27:04,929 --> 03:27:07,180
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...

12
03:27:07,430 --> 03:27:10,934
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.

13
03:27:12,644 --> 03:27:14,729
But sometimes a storm...

14
03:27:14,979 --> 03:27:16,606
...is just a storm.

15
03:27:16,856 --> 03:27:18,358
Not this time.

16
03:27:18,608 --> 03:27:21,068
Armies of Orcs are on the move.

17
03:27:21,320 --> 03:27:23,655
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.

18
03:27:23,905 --> 03:27:26,532
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

19
03:27:26,784 --> 03:27:28,325
Why show his hand now?

20
03:27:28,577 --> 03:27:29,827
Because we forced him.

21
03:27:30,079 --> 03:27:33,247
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
set out to reclaim...

22
03:27:33,499 --> 03:27:34,874
...their homeland.
