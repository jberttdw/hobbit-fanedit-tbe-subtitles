1
01:36:19,161 --> 01:36:21,162
Wait!

2
01:36:21,163 --> 01:36:24,415
My precious. Wait!

3
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:28,169
Gollum, gollum!

4
01:36:32,174 --> 01:36:35,635
Quick, quick!

5
01:36:35,636 --> 01:36:36,886
This way.

6
01:36:39,431 --> 01:36:44,431
Come on.
Come on, come on. Quickly.

7
01:36:45,187 --> 01:36:50,187
Right, good!

8
01:38:13,942 --> 01:38:16,652
Baggins!

9
01:38:16,653 --> 01:38:19,488
Thief!

10
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:24,489
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!

11
01:38:37,341 --> 01:38:40,259
Five, six, seven, eight.

12
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,720
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

13
01:38:42,721 --> 01:38:45,514
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

14
01:38:45,515 --> 01:38:49,435
And Bombur. That makes 13.

15
01:38:49,436 --> 01:38:51,562
Where's Bilbo?

16
01:38:51,563 --> 01:38:54,732
Where is our Hobbit?

17
01:38:54,733 --> 01:38:57,777
Where is our Hobbit?

18
01:38:57,778 --> 01:38:59,612
Curse that Half ling!

19
01:38:59,613 --> 01:39:00,905
Now he's lost?

20
01:39:00,906 --> 01:39:03,074
I thought he was with Dori!

21
01:39:03,075 --> 01:39:04,325
Don't blame me!

22
01:39:04,326 --> 01:39:05,660
Where did you last see him?

23
01:39:05,661 --> 01:39:06,577
I think I saw him...

24
01:39:06,578 --> 01:39:07,536
...slip away...

25
01:39:07,537 --> 01:39:08,496
...when they first collared us.

26
01:39:08,497 --> 01:39:10,122
And what happened, exactly?

27
01:39:10,123 --> 01:39:12,625
<i>- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.</i>

28
01:39:12,626 --> 01:39:14,460
Master Baggins saw his chance...

29
01:39:14,461 --> 01:39:16,254
...and he took it.

30
01:39:16,255 --> 01:39:19,173
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

31
01:39:19,174 --> 01:39:22,051
...since first he stepped out of his door.

32
01:39:22,052 --> 01:39:25,012
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

33
01:39:25,013 --> 01:39:30,013
He is long gone.

34
01:39:38,777 --> 01:39:40,778
No.

35
01:39:40,779 --> 01:39:45,741
He isn't.

36
01:39:45,742 --> 01:39:47,576
Bilbo Baggins.

37
01:39:47,577 --> 01:39:48,953
I have never been so glad...

38
01:39:48,954 --> 01:39:52,540
...to see anyone in my life.

39
01:39:52,541 --> 01:39:53,708
Bilbo.

40
01:39:53,709 --> 01:39:54,667
We'd given you up.

41
01:39:54,668 --> 01:39:56,836
How on earth
did you get past the Goblins?

42
01:39:56,837 --> 01:40:01,757
How, indeed.

43
01:40:07,556 --> 01:40:11,642
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

44
01:40:11,643 --> 01:40:13,144
It matters.

45
01:40:13,145 --> 01:40:16,689
I want to know.

46
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:21,690
Why did you come back?

47
01:40:21,737 --> 01:40:26,737
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

48
01:40:27,034 --> 01:40:29,910
And you're right.
I often think of Bag-end.

49
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:32,705
I miss my books.

50
01:40:32,706 --> 01:40:36,500
And my armchair and my garden.

51
01:40:36,501 --> 01:40:38,544
See, that's where I belong.

52
01:40:38,545 --> 01:40:42,006
That's home.

53
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:46,427
And that's why I came back. Because...

54
01:40:46,428 --> 01:40:49,972
...you don't have one. A home.

55
01:40:49,973 --> 01:40:54,643
It was taken from you.

56
01:40:54,644 --> 01:40:59,644
But I will help you take it back if I can.
