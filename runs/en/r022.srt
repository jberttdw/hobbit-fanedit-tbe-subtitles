1
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,169
Our business is no concern of Elves.

2
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:57,129
For goodness sake, Thorin...

3
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,006
...show him the map.
It is the legacy...

4
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:00,508
...of my people.

5
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:04,262
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

6
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:06,973
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.

7
01:03:06,974 --> 01:03:10,101
Your pride will be your downfall.

8
01:03:10,102 --> 01:03:13,187
You stand in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...

9
01:03:13,188 --> 01:03:18,188
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

10
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:28,949
Thorin, no.

11
01:03:35,085 --> 01:03:38,129
Erebor.

12
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,089
What is your interest...

13
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:43,217
...in this map?

14
01:03:43,218 --> 01:03:45,094
It's mainly academic.

15
01:03:45,095 --> 01:03:46,053
As you know...

16
01:03:46,054 --> 01:03:51,054
...this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

17
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,480
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?

18
01:04:06,283 --> 01:04:08,910
Moon runes?

19
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,537
Of course.

20
01:04:11,538 --> 01:04:13,497
An easy thing to miss.

21
01:04:13,498 --> 01:04:15,291
Well, in this case, that is true.

22
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:17,960
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

23
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:20,296
...of the same shape and season...

24
01:04:20,297 --> 01:04:23,132
...as the day on which they were written.

25
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:28,133
Can you read them?

26
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:32,767
These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

27
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:37,647
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.

28
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:41,359
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

29
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,818
Fate is with you...

30
01:04:42,819 --> 01:04:44,779
...Thorin Oakenshield. The same moon...

31
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:49,780
...shines upon us tonight.

32
01:05:06,176 --> 01:05:07,343
"Stand by the...

33
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:10,930
...gray stone when the thrush knocks...

34
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:15,931
...and the setting sun with
the last light of Durin's Day...

35
01:05:15,936 --> 01:05:20,481
-...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?

36
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:24,110
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...

37
01:05:24,111 --> 01:05:27,154
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

38
01:05:27,155 --> 01:05:29,240
This is ill news.

39
01:05:29,241 --> 01:05:31,951
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

40
01:05:31,952 --> 01:05:33,411
We still have time.

41
01:05:33,412 --> 01:05:36,038
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.

42
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:40,001
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.

43
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,963
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

44
01:05:43,964 --> 01:05:44,880
So this is...

45
01:05:44,881 --> 01:05:48,384
...your purpose, to enter the mountain?

46
01:05:48,385 --> 01:05:49,927
What of it'?

47
01:05:49,928 --> 01:05:54,473
There are some who would not deem it wise.

48
01:05:54,474 --> 01:05:57,059
What do you mean?

49
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:02,060
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.
