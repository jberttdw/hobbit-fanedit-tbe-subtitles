1
03:48:53,926 --> 03:48:55,760
Since when do we forsake...

2
03:48:56,011 --> 03:48:57,178
...our own people?

3
03:48:57,430 --> 03:48:58,430
Thorin...

4
03:48:59,181 --> 03:49:00,181
...they are dying...

5
03:49:00,432 --> 03:49:01,600
...out there.

6
03:49:06,939 --> 03:49:10,191
There are halls beneath halls
within this Mountain.

7
03:49:12,319 --> 03:49:14,445
Places we can fortify...

8
03:49:15,739 --> 03:49:17,364
...shore up, make safe.

9
03:49:17,617 --> 03:49:18,783
Yes.

10
03:49:20,453 --> 03:49:21,453
Yes...

11
03:49:22,663 --> 03:49:23,663
...that is it.

12
03:49:24,623 --> 03:49:26,624
We must move the gold
further underground...

13
03:49:26,876 --> 03:49:28,251
- ...to safety.
- Did you hear me?

14
03:49:28,502 --> 03:49:30,669
Dain is surrounded.

15
03:49:30,922 --> 03:49:32,631
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

16
03:49:35,133 --> 03:49:36,592
Many die in war.

17
03:49:37,845 --> 03:49:39,428
Life is cheap.

18
03:49:41,556 --> 03:49:42,556
But a treasure...

19
03:49:42,807 --> 03:49:44,767
...such as this cannot be counted...

20
03:49:45,019 --> 03:49:46,685
...in lives lost.

21
03:49:49,774 --> 03:49:51,274
It is worth...

22
03:49:51,525 --> 03:49:54,026
...all the blood we can spend.

23
03:49:55,695 --> 03:49:58,114
You sit here in these vast halls...

24
03:49:58,365 --> 03:50:00,824
...with a crown upon your head...

25
03:50:01,577 --> 03:50:04,663
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

26
03:50:06,498 --> 03:50:08,416
Do not speak to me...

27
03:50:10,086 --> 03:50:12,127
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...

28
03:50:14,006 --> 03:50:15,006
...as if...

29
03:50:15,216 --> 03:50:17,676
...I were still...

30
03:50:20,680 --> 03:50:22,180
...Thorin...

31
03:50:22,890 --> 03:50:24,849
...Oakenshield.

32
03:50:26,769 --> 03:50:29,354
- I am your king!
- You were always my king.

33
03:50:29,771 --> 03:50:31,648
You used to know that once.

34
03:50:32,984 --> 03:50:35,569
You cannot see what you have become.

35
03:50:39,030 --> 03:50:40,239
Go.

36
03:50:42,993 --> 03:50:44,285
Get out.

37
03:50:46,788 --> 03:50:48,623
Before I kill you.

38
03:51:03,180 --> 03:51:04,346
You sit here...

39
03:51:04,599 --> 03:51:07,434
...with a crown upon your head.

40
03:51:07,685 --> 03:51:09,727
You are lesser now
than you have ever been.

41
03:51:09,979 --> 03:51:13,981
But a treasure such as this
cannot be counted in lives lost.

42
03:51:14,233 --> 03:51:16,234
A sickness lies upon that treasure.

43
03:51:16,485 --> 03:51:18,861
The blind ambition of a Mountain King.

44
03:51:19,113 --> 03:51:20,363
Am I not the king?

45
03:51:20,614 --> 03:51:21,948
This gold...

46
03:51:22,199 --> 03:51:23,533
...is ours.

47
03:51:23,784 --> 03:51:25,284
And ours alone.

48
03:51:26,369 --> 03:51:28,913
I will not part...

49
03:51:29,832 --> 03:51:32,083
...with a single coin.

50
03:51:32,334 --> 03:51:34,127
He could not see
beyond his own desire!

51
03:51:34,377 --> 03:51:36,879
As if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...

52
03:51:37,131 --> 03:51:39,215
...Thorin Oakenshield.

53
03:51:39,467 --> 03:51:42,968
A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.

54
03:51:43,220 --> 03:51:44,846
This is Thorin...

55
03:51:45,096 --> 03:51:47,724
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!

56
03:51:47,975 --> 03:51:50,185
I am not my grandfather.
I am not my grandfather.

57
03:51:50,435 --> 03:51:52,354
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin.

58
03:51:52,605 --> 03:51:54,480
They are dying out there.

59
03:51:54,731 --> 03:51:55,940
Take back Erebor.

60
03:51:56,191 --> 03:51:57,609
Dain is surrounded.

61
03:51:57,860 --> 03:51:58,860
Dying.

62
03:51:59,110 --> 03:52:00,110
Is surrounded.

63
03:52:00,363 --> 03:52:01,363
Dying.

64
03:52:01,614 --> 03:52:04,449
Take back your homeland.

65
03:52:05,034 --> 03:52:07,202
You are changed, Thorin.

66
03:52:07,453 --> 03:52:09,078
I am not my grandfather.

67
03:52:09,329 --> 03:52:12,373
Is this treasure truly worth more
than your honor?

68
03:52:12,624 --> 03:52:14,751
I am not my grandfather.
