00:59:47,322 --> 00:59:50,867
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

2
00:59:50,868 --> 00:59:53,745
I do not believe we have met.

3
00:59:53,746 --> 00:59:56,998
You have your grandfather's bearing.

4
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:58,750
I knew Thror when he ruled...

5
00:59:58,751 --> 01:00:03,751
-...Under the Mountain.
-Indeed? He made no mention of you.

6
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:16,601
What is he saying?

7
01:00:16,602 --> 01:00:19,228
Does he offer us insult?

8
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:24,229
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.

9
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:30,823
Well...

10
01:00:30,824 --> 01:00:34,076
...in that case, lead on.

11
01:00:34,077 --> 01:00:35,453
Hey. Come on.

12
01:00:35,454 --> 01:00:38,498
Try it. Just a mouthful.

13
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:41,292
I don't like green food.

14
01:00:41,293 --> 01:00:42,460
Where's the meat?

15
01:00:43,921 --> 01:00:46,380
Have they got any chips?

16
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:47,423
Kind of you...

17
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:49,050
...to invite us.

18
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:50,802
Not really dressed for dinner.

19
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:52,220
Well, you never are.
