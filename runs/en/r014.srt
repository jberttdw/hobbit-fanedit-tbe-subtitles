1
00:48:27,144 --> 00:48:30,063
- Bilbo!
- Don't!

2
00:48:30,064 --> 00:48:32,732
Lay down your arms...

3
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:37,733
...or we'll rip his off.

4
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:53,169
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!
- Don't bother cooking them.

5
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,590
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.

6
00:48:57,591 --> 00:49:01,969
They should be sauteed and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.

7
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:03,679
Is this really necessary?

8
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,640
That does sound quite nice.

9
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:08,768
Untie me, mister.
Eat someone your own size.

10
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:10,853
WILLIAM:
Never mind the seasoning.

11
00:49:10,854 --> 00:49:13,606
We ain't got all night. Dawn ain't...

12
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:16,317
...far away. Let's get a move on.

13
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,318
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

14
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:22,949
Wait!

15
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,283
You are making...

16
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:26,160
...a terrible mistake.

17
00:49:26,161 --> 00:49:27,703
You can't reason with them.

18
00:49:27,704 --> 00:49:29,163
- They're half-wits!
BOFUR: Half-wits?

19
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:31,207
What does that make us?

20
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:33,167
I meant with...

21
00:49:33,168 --> 00:49:34,335
...the seasoning.

22
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:37,171
What about the seasoning?

23
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:38,714
Well, have you smelt them?

24
00:49:38,715 --> 00:49:42,468
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.

25
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:44,095
Traitor!
What do you know...

26
00:49:44,096 --> 00:49:46,139
...about cooking Dwarf?

27
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,473
Shut up.

28
00:49:47,474 --> 00:49:52,061
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

29
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:55,189
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

30
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,484
Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
-It's, uh...

31
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:03,030
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

32
00:50:03,031 --> 00:50:04,991
...to skin them first.

33
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:07,994
What? Skin us?

34
00:50:07,995 --> 00:50:09,787
Tom, get me filleting knife.

35
00:50:09,788 --> 00:50:11,622
I'll skin you, you little--!

36
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:13,624
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

37
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:16,169
What a load of rubbish.

38
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,255
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

39
00:50:19,256 --> 00:50:20,381
Scarf them, I say...

40
00:50:20,382 --> 00:50:22,258
...boots and all.

41
00:50:22,259 --> 00:50:24,719
He's right.

42
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,720
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

43
00:50:30,017 --> 00:50:32,560
Nice and crunchy.

44
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:33,978
Oh, not that one.

45
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:35,313
He's infected.

46
00:50:35,314 --> 00:50:36,230
Huh?

47
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,231
You what?

48
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:41,527
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

49
00:50:41,528 --> 00:50:42,528
Eww!

50
00:50:42,529 --> 00:50:43,696
Aah!

51
00:50:43,697 --> 00:50:45,448
In fact, they all have.

52
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:48,242
They're infested with parasites.
It's a terrible business.

53
00:50:48,243 --> 00:50:50,161
I wouldn't risk it. I wouldn't.

54
00:50:50,162 --> 00:50:51,078
Parasites?

55
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:53,164
Did he say "parasites"?

56
00:50:53,165 --> 00:50:55,917
We don't have parasites.
You have parasites!

57
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:58,044
What are you talking about, laddie?

58
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,382
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

59
00:51:03,383 --> 00:51:06,177
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.

60
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:09,722
We're riddled.
Yes, I'm riddled.

61
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:11,140
Yes, we are, badly.

62
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:14,185
What would you have us do, then?

63
00:51:14,186 --> 00:51:16,062
Let them all go?

64
00:51:16,063 --> 00:51:17,730
- Well...
You think...

65
00:51:17,731 --> 00:51:19,815
...I don't know what you're up to?

66
00:51:19,816 --> 00:51:20,900
This little...

67
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:24,153
...ferret is taking us for fools.

68
00:51:24,154 --> 00:51:25,154
Ferret?

69
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:26,113
Fools?

70
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:30,451
The dawn will take you all.

71
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:31,410
Who's that?

72
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:32,328
No idea.

73
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:36,791
Can we eat him too?

74
00:51:59,523 --> 00:52:02,483
Get your foot out of my back.

75
00:52:08,073 --> 00:52:11,367
Ah.

76
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:12,368
Where did you...

77
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:13,953
...go to, if I may ask?

78
00:52:13,954 --> 00:52:15,955
To look ahead.

79
00:52:15,956 --> 00:52:17,123
What brought you back?

80
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:19,792
Looking behind.

81
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:21,210
Nasty business.

82
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:22,962
Still, they're all in one piece.

83
00:52:22,963 --> 00:52:25,798
No thanks to your burglar.

84
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:29,302
He had the nous to play for time.

85
00:52:29,303 --> 00:52:33,764
None of the rest of you thought of that.
