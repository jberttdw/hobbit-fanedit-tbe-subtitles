1
01:56:05,482 --> 01:56:07,803
The Elven Gate.

2
01:56:08,922 --> 01:56:10,287
Here lies our path...

3
01:56:10,562 --> 01:56:12,052
through Mirkwood.

4
01:56:12,402 --> 01:56:15,451
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.

5
01:56:22,682 --> 01:56:24,810
Set the ponies loose.

6
01:56:25,282 --> 01:56:27,888
Let them return to their master.

7
01:56:29,802 --> 01:56:30,724
This forest...

8
01:56:31,002 --> 01:56:32,413
feels...

9
01:56:33,042 --> 01:56:34,123
sick.

10
01:56:34,602 --> 01:56:36,809
As if a disease lies upon it.

11
01:56:39,322 --> 01:56:40,926
Is there no way around?

12
01:56:41,162 --> 01:56:43,642
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

13
01:56:43,882 --> 01:56:45,964
Or twice that distance...

14
01:56:46,922 --> 01:56:48,208
south.
