1
03:29:09,001 --> 03:29:12,421
Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?

2
03:29:12,671 --> 03:29:14,339
What do you think I'm trying to do?

3
03:29:14,589 --> 03:29:17,133
Save your Dwarvish friends,
and I admire...

4
03:29:17,385 --> 03:29:19,593
...your loyalty to them.

5
03:29:19,845 --> 03:29:22,597
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.

6
03:29:23,390 --> 03:29:25,767
You started this, Mithrandir.

7
03:29:26,352 --> 03:29:29,312
You will forgive me if I finish it.

8
03:29:29,564 --> 03:29:31,272
Are the archers in position?

9
03:29:32,149 --> 03:29:34,359
- Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.

10
03:29:34,986 --> 03:29:37,236
If anything moves on that Mountain...

11
03:29:37,488 --> 03:29:38,571
...kill it.

12
03:29:41,575 --> 03:29:43,827
The Dwarves are out of time.
