1
02:20:40,332 --> 02:20:41,254
Do it again...

2
02:20:42,052 --> 02:20:43,133
and you're dead.

3
02:20:45,852 --> 02:20:47,058
Excuse me...

4
02:20:47,292 --> 02:20:50,421
but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

5
02:20:51,372 --> 02:20:53,898
That barge over there...

6
02:20:54,132 --> 02:20:57,420
it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

7
02:20:59,092 --> 02:21:01,174
What makes you think I would help you?

8
02:21:01,452 --> 02:21:03,261
Those boots have seen better days.

9
02:21:03,852 --> 02:21:05,422
As has that coat.

10
02:21:06,492 --> 02:21:08,460
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

11
02:21:09,572 --> 02:21:10,983
How many bairns?

12
02:21:11,892 --> 02:21:13,542
A boy and two girls.

13
02:21:14,532 --> 02:21:17,103
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

14
02:21:18,372 --> 02:21:19,453
Aye.

15
02:21:19,892 --> 02:21:20,973
She was.

16
02:21:24,212 --> 02:21:25,702
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

17
02:21:25,972 --> 02:21:27,815
Come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

18
02:21:29,492 --> 02:21:30,618
What's your hurry?

19
02:21:30,892 --> 02:21:32,098
What's it to you?

20
02:21:32,412 --> 02:21:34,016
I would like to know who you are...

21
02:21:35,252 --> 02:21:36,892
and what you are doing in these lands.

22
02:21:37,012 --> 02:21:39,538
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

23
02:21:39,892 --> 02:21:41,337
journeying to see our kin...

24
02:21:41,612 --> 02:21:43,182
in the Iron Hills.

25
02:21:44,572 --> 02:21:46,540
Simple merchants, you say?

26
02:21:46,772 --> 02:21:48,103
We need food...

27
02:21:48,372 --> 02:21:50,340
supplies, weapons.

28
02:21:50,572 --> 02:21:51,733
Can you help us?

29
02:21:56,252 --> 02:21:58,537
I know where these...
..barrels came from.

30
02:21:59,292 --> 02:22:00,532
What of it?

31
02:22:00,772 --> 02:22:03,218
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

32
02:22:03,732 --> 02:22:05,461
but I don't think it ended well.

33
02:22:07,132 --> 02:22:07,815
No one enters Lake-town...

34
02:22:08,052 --> 02:22:10,020
but by leave of the Master.

35
02:22:10,732 --> 02:22:13,417
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

36
02:22:13,692 --> 02:22:16,457
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

37
02:22:18,372 --> 02:22:19,339
Offer him more.

38
02:22:22,252 --> 02:22:22,935
I'll wager there are...

39
02:22:23,172 --> 02:22:25,095
ways to enter that town unseen.

40
02:22:25,972 --> 02:22:27,053
Aye.

41
02:22:28,412 --> 02:22:29,652
But for that...

42
02:22:30,852 --> 02:22:32,263
you would need a smuggler.

43
02:22:32,492 --> 02:22:34,415
For which we would pay double.
