1
04:00:41,979 --> 04:00:42,979
It's Thorin.

2
04:00:43,730 --> 04:00:44,773
And Fili, Kili...

3
04:00:45,399 --> 04:00:46,774
...and Dwalin.

4
04:00:47,818 --> 04:00:49,819
He's taking his best warriors.

5
04:00:50,071 --> 04:00:51,279
To do what?

6
04:00:52,156 --> 04:00:54,532
To cut the head off the snake.

7
04:01:28,318 --> 04:01:29,318
Die!

8
04:01:36,326 --> 04:01:37,701
Gandalf!

9
04:01:38,411 --> 04:01:39,620
Legolas.

10
04:01:41,247 --> 04:01:42,413
Legolas Greenleaf.

11
04:01:42,665 --> 04:01:43,873
There is a second army.

12
04:01:44,125 --> 04:01:47,085
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.

13
04:01:47,336 --> 04:01:48,795
Gundabad.

14
04:01:50,005 --> 04:01:51,672
This was their plan all along.

15
04:01:54,385 --> 04:01:57,845
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.

16
04:01:58,096 --> 04:01:59,473
The North?

17
04:01:59,724 --> 04:02:01,058
Where is the North...

18
04:02:01,309 --> 04:02:03,393
- ...exactly?
- Ravenhill.

19
04:02:04,604 --> 04:02:05,645
Ravenhill?

20
04:02:05,897 --> 04:02:07,564
Thorin is up there.

21
04:02:07,814 --> 04:02:09,815
And Fili and Kili. They're all up there.
