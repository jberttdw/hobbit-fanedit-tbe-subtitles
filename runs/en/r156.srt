1
04:12:19,166 --> 04:12:21,334
There is to be a great feast tonight.

2
04:12:21,585 --> 04:12:24,837
Songs will be sung. Tales will be told.

3
04:12:25,590 --> 04:12:27,716
And Thorin Oakenshield...

4
04:12:27,967 --> 04:12:30,010
...will pass into legend.

5
04:12:31,344 --> 04:12:33,055
I know that's how you must honor him.

6
04:12:33,306 --> 04:12:35,182
But to me, he was never that.

7
04:12:36,391 --> 04:12:37,641
He was...

8
04:12:39,020 --> 04:12:40,311
To me...

9
04:12:42,105 --> 04:12:43,355
...he was...

10
04:12:50,489 --> 04:12:53,450
I'll slip quietly away.
Will you tell the others I said goodbye?

11
04:12:53,700 --> 04:12:55,494
You can tell them yourself.

12
04:13:11,802 --> 04:13:15,138
If any of you are ever
passing Bag End, uh...

13
04:13:20,227 --> 04:13:21,520
...tea is at 4.

14
04:13:23,147 --> 04:13:24,730
There's plenty of it.

15
04:13:27,360 --> 04:13:29,277
You are welcome anytime.

16
04:13:35,243 --> 04:13:36,618
Uh...

17
04:13:38,037 --> 04:13:39,538
Don't bother knocking.

18
04:14:22,122 --> 04:14:24,290
Ah, the borders of the Shire.

19
04:14:26,252 --> 04:14:28,043
It is here I must leave you.

20
04:14:30,715 --> 04:14:32,090
That's a shame.

21
04:14:34,635 --> 04:14:36,302
I quite liked having...

22
04:14:36,554 --> 04:14:38,263
...a Wizard around.

23
04:14:39,514 --> 04:14:41,265
Seems they bring good luck.

24
04:14:42,351 --> 04:14:45,728
You don't really suppose, do you,
that all your adventures and escapes...

25
04:14:45,979 --> 04:14:48,147
...were managed by mere luck?

26
04:14:49,149 --> 04:14:52,318
Magic rings should not be used lightly,
Bilbo.

27
04:14:52,569 --> 04:14:53,861
Don't take me for a fool.

28
04:14:54,112 --> 04:14:56,573
I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels.

29
04:14:56,824 --> 04:14:58,867
And I've kept my eye on you...

30
04:14:59,118 --> 04:15:00,201
...ever since.

31
04:15:03,371 --> 04:15:04,956
Well, thank goodness.

32
04:15:09,670 --> 04:15:11,296
Farewell, Gandalf.

33
04:15:14,217 --> 04:15:15,634
Farewell.

34
04:15:22,808 --> 04:15:24,058
You, uh...

35
04:15:24,309 --> 04:15:27,938
You needn't worry about that ring.
Fell out of my pocket during the battle.

36
04:15:28,189 --> 04:15:29,272
I lost it.

37
04:15:30,191 --> 04:15:33,485
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins.

38
04:15:34,444 --> 04:15:35,444
And I'm very fond...

39
04:15:35,695 --> 04:15:36,862
...of you.

40
04:15:38,574 --> 04:15:40,908
But you're only quite a little fellow...

41
04:15:42,161 --> 04:15:44,995
...in a wide world after all.

42
04:16:16,279 --> 04:16:19,155
Wait a minute,
that's my mother's glory box.

43
04:16:19,406 --> 04:16:21,700
And that's my dining chair.

44
04:16:21,950 --> 04:16:24,952
Ah... Put that pouf down!

45
04:16:25,203 --> 04:16:26,704
What is going on?

46
04:16:27,290 --> 04:16:28,290
Hello...

47
04:16:28,415 --> 04:16:29,415
...Mr. Bilbo.

48
04:16:29,541 --> 04:16:31,166
You're not supposed to be here.

49
04:16:31,418 --> 04:16:33,043
What do you mean?

50
04:16:33,296 --> 04:16:34,879
On account of you
being presumed dead.

51
04:16:35,840 --> 04:16:37,299
I am not dead.

52
04:16:37,549 --> 04:16:39,384
Presumed or otherwise.

53
04:16:40,511 --> 04:16:42,429
I'm not sure that's permitted.

54
04:16:42,680 --> 04:16:44,263
Mr. Bilbo!

55
04:16:44,514 --> 04:16:46,933
Twenty-one! Any advance on 21?

56
04:16:47,183 --> 04:16:48,934
Any advance on 21?

57
04:16:49,311 --> 04:16:52,063
Ha, ha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger.

58
04:16:52,315 --> 04:16:54,691
Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on.

59
04:16:56,818 --> 04:16:57,861
Any bids for this?

60
04:16:58,111 --> 04:17:00,447
This is Shire-made.

61
04:17:00,698 --> 04:17:02,489
No Dwarvish reproductions here.

62
04:17:02,742 --> 04:17:03,742
Stop!

63
04:17:03,993 --> 04:17:05,243
Stop!

64
04:17:05,494 --> 04:17:07,537
- There's been a mistake!
- Who are you?

65
04:17:07,788 --> 04:17:08,788
Who am I?

66
04:17:09,040 --> 04:17:10,497
You know who I am...

67
04:17:10,750 --> 04:17:12,584
...Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

68
04:17:12,834 --> 04:17:14,209
This is my home.

69
04:17:14,461 --> 04:17:16,712
And those are my spoons.
Thank you very much.

70
04:17:16,963 --> 04:17:18,590
- This is most irregular.
- Excuse me.

71
04:17:18,841 --> 04:17:19,841
It's been more...

72
04:17:19,924 --> 04:17:22,218
...than 13 months since the disappearance.

73
04:17:22,469 --> 04:17:24,094
If you are in fact...

74
04:17:24,346 --> 04:17:27,389
...Bilbo Baggins and undeceased...

75
04:17:27,640 --> 04:17:29,183
...can you prove it?

76
04:17:29,434 --> 04:17:30,434
What?

77
04:17:30,477 --> 04:17:32,102
Something official with your name...

78
04:17:32,354 --> 04:17:33,438
...on it would suffice.

79
04:17:33,689 --> 04:17:35,565
All right. Right.

80
04:17:38,443 --> 04:17:40,736
A contract of employment as a bur...

81
04:17:43,406 --> 04:17:44,406
Never mind as what.

82
04:17:46,369 --> 04:17:47,744
There. My signature.

83
04:17:47,995 --> 04:17:49,995
Yes, well... Uh...

84
04:17:50,246 --> 04:17:52,082
Well, it certainly seems to be in order.

85
04:17:52,333 --> 04:17:53,458
Yes.

86
04:17:53,709 --> 04:17:55,752
Seems there can be no doubt.

87
04:17:56,711 --> 04:17:58,587
Who is this you pledged
your service to?

88
04:18:00,632 --> 04:18:02,174
Thorin Oakenshield?

89
04:18:05,638 --> 04:18:06,638
He...

90
04:18:07,722 --> 04:18:09,264
He was my friend.

91
04:20:04,215 --> 04:20:05,631
No, thank you!

92
04:20:05,882 --> 04:20:08,050
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers...

93
04:20:08,301 --> 04:20:10,512
...or distant relations!

94
04:20:10,763 --> 04:20:11,845
And what about...

95
04:20:12,096 --> 04:20:13,847
...very old friends?

96
04:20:21,440 --> 04:20:22,440
Gandalf?

97
04:20:22,649 --> 04:20:23,941
Bilbo Baggins.

98
04:20:24,192 --> 04:20:26,152
My dear Gandalf! Ha, ha!

99
04:20:26,403 --> 04:20:27,611
It's good to see you.

100
04:20:27,862 --> 04:20:31,449
One hundred and 11 years old.
Who would believe it?

101
04:20:35,663 --> 04:20:37,621
Come on, come in!

102
04:20:37,872 --> 04:20:40,165
Welcome. Welcome.
