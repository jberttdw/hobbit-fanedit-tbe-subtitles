1
02:17:27,332 --> 02:17:28,052
Everyone...

2
02:17:28,212 --> 02:17:30,532
- ...climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?

3
02:17:31,652 --> 02:17:32,335
- They'll find us.
- No, no.

4
02:17:32,572 --> 02:17:33,619
They won't, I promise you.

5
02:17:33,852 --> 02:17:37,379
Please, please. You must trust me.

6
02:17:41,252 --> 02:17:42,333
Do as he says.

7
02:17:43,452 --> 02:17:44,812
Move your big ginger head.

8
02:17:46,892 --> 02:17:49,655
Bifur, get in... the barrel!
Move!

9
02:17:56,372 --> 02:17:58,022
Everyone's in.

10
02:18:01,172 --> 02:18:03,061
What do we do now?

11
02:18:03,812 --> 02:18:04,813
Hold your breath.

12
02:18:05,052 --> 02:18:06,652
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

13
02:18:32,732 --> 02:18:34,257
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

14
02:19:01,412 --> 02:19:02,618
Well done, Master Baggins.

15
02:19:04,172 --> 02:19:05,333
Go! Come on, let's go!

16
02:19:15,332 --> 02:19:16,982
Hold on!

17
02:19:30,212 --> 02:19:31,543
Bilbo!

18
02:19:36,132 --> 02:19:37,372
Hang on!

19
02:19:39,092 --> 02:19:41,299
- Help!
- Ori!
