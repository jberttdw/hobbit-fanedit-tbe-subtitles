1
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:28,621
We'll camp here for the night.

2
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:33,250
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.

3
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:37,505
A farmer and his family used to live here.

4
00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:40,466
Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.
Aye.

5
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,676
Right you are.

6
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:46,263
I think it would be wiser to move on.

7
00:40:46,264 --> 00:40:49,433
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

8
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:51,519
I have told you already...

9
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,562
...I will not go near that place.

10
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:56,023
Why not? The Elves could help us.

11
00:40:56,024 --> 00:40:58,275
We could get food, rest, advice.

12
00:40:58,276 --> 00:41:01,696
I do not need their advice.
We have a map...

13
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:04,782
...that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.

14
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:07,159
Help?

15
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,453
A dragon attacks Erebor.

16
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:12,748
What help came from the Elves?

17
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,875
Orcs plunder Moria...

18
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:18,587
...desecrate our sacred halls.
The Elves looked on...

19
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:21,298
...and did nothing.

20
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:25,553
And you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grandfather.

21
00:41:25,554 --> 00:41:27,013
Who betrayed my father.

22
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:29,557
You are neither of them.

23
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:30,474
I did not...

24
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:33,436
...give you that map and key
for you to hold onto the past.

25
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:38,437
I did not know
that they were yours to keep.

26
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,488
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

27
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:48,075
To seek the company of the
only one around here who's got any sense.

28
00:41:48,076 --> 00:41:49,035
And who's that?

29
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:51,162
Myself, Mr. Baggins.

30
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:55,583
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

31
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:58,210
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

32
00:41:58,211 --> 00:42:03,211
Is he coming back?

33
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,302
He's been a long time.

34
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:07,762
- Who?
- Gandalf.

35
00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:10,097
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

36
00:42:10,098 --> 00:42:13,684
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.

37
00:42:13,685 --> 00:42:15,436
Stop it. You've had plenty.

38
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:19,273
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur.
I've had worse.

39
00:42:19,274 --> 00:42:21,484
Dori could've cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.

40
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:26,485
Hilarious.

41
00:42:34,372 --> 00:42:35,873
What's the matter?

42
00:42:35,874 --> 00:42:40,461
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.

43
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:42,546
We had 16.

44
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:47,547
Now there's 14.

45
00:42:48,678 --> 00:42:51,180
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

46
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:53,099
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

47
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,893
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

48
00:42:55,894 --> 00:42:58,979
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

49
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,399
As our official burglar,
we thought you might like to look into it.

50
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,276
Well, uh...

51
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:08,656
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.

52
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:13,657
It's something very big
and possibly quite dangerous.

53
00:43:13,954 --> 00:43:15,579
Hey-

54
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,748
There's a light.

55
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:21,669
Over here.

56
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,380
Stay down.

57
00:43:28,176 --> 00:43:29,802
What is it?

58
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:34,803
Trolls.

59
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:50,781
Oh.

60
00:43:58,123 --> 00:44:03,123
He's got Myrtle and Minty. I think they're
gonna eat them. We have to do something.

61
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:06,213
Yes, you should.

62
00:44:06,214 --> 00:44:07,840
Mountain Trolls are slow...

63
00:44:07,841 --> 00:44:10,467
...and stupid, and you're small,
they'll never see you.

64
00:44:10,468 --> 00:44:12,636
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.

65
00:44:12,637 --> 00:44:14,763
If you run into trouble,
hoot twice like a barn owl...

66
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:16,348
...and once like a brown owl.

67
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:19,435
Twice like a barn owl.
No, twice like a brown-- Once like a--

68
00:44:19,436 --> 00:44:21,812
Like a-- Are you sure this is a good idea?

69
00:44:21,813 --> 00:44:25,024
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

70
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:29,612
...and, blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.

71
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:31,780
Quit your griping.

72
00:44:31,781 --> 00:44:36,202
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

73
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:40,581
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have.

74
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:42,875
- Not enough fat on them.
Well, it's better...

75
00:44:42,876 --> 00:44:45,753
...than leathery old farmer.
All skin and bone, he was.

76
00:44:45,754 --> 00:44:46,921
I'm still picking...

77
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:48,756
...bits of him out of me teeth.

78
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:53,260
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

79
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:55,387
Might improve the flavor.

80
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:58,140
Ah. There's more where that came from.

81
00:44:58,141 --> 00:44:59,683
- Oh, no, you don't!
Ow!

82
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:07,066
Sit down!

83
00:45:13,323 --> 00:45:17,743
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.

84
00:45:17,744 --> 00:45:20,746
I don't like the stinky parts.

85
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:23,749
- Ow!
- I said sit down.

86
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,959
I'm starving!

87
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,212
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?

88
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:30,339
Shut your cakehole.

89
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,133
You'll eat what I give you.

90
00:45:33,134 --> 00:45:37,012
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.

91
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:38,764
Everything tastes like chicken.

92
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:40,182
Except the chicken.

93
00:45:40,183 --> 00:45:41,642
What tastes like fish!

94
00:45:41,643 --> 00:45:44,895
I'm just saying,
a little appreciation would be nice.

95
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:49,900
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert.

96
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:51,277
Lovely stew, Bert."

97
00:45:51,278 --> 00:45:55,531
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

98
00:45:55,532 --> 00:45:56,490
Just needs...

99
00:45:56,491 --> 00:45:59,535
...a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

100
00:45:59,536 --> 00:46:00,452
Here...

101
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:01,704
...that's my grog.

102
00:46:04,165 --> 00:46:09,044
Sorry. Ow!

103
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:13,841
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.

104
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:17,761
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

105
00:46:17,762 --> 00:46:19,179
Good, isn't it?

106
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:23,767
That's why I'm the cook.

107
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:35,487
Oh, me guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.

108
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:38,741
- Flesh, I need flesh.
Ah! Ah!

109
00:46:41,661 --> 00:46:43,454
Blimey!

110
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,540
Bert. Bert!
Look what's come out of me hooter.

111
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,959
It's got arms and legs and everything.

112
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,378
What is it?
- I don't know.

113
00:46:51,379 --> 00:46:56,379
I don't like the way it wriggles around.

114
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,679
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?

115
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,556
I'm a burglar-- Uh, Hobbit.

116
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:04,808
A burglar Hobbit?

117
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:06,602
Can we cook him?

118
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:11,603
We can try.

119
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,193
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

120
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:17,154
Not when he's skinned and boned.

121
00:47:17,155 --> 00:47:18,739
Perhaps there's more...

122
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,367
...burglar Hobbits around these parts.
Might be enough...

123
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:23,619
...for a pie.

124
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,788
- Grab him!
He's too quick.

125
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:29,291
Right. Come here, you little--

126
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:30,793
Gotcha.

127
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:33,253
Are there any more of you little fellas...

128
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:36,423
-...hiding where you shouldn't?
- No.

129
00:47:36,424 --> 00:47:37,966
He's lying.

130
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:42,471
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.

131
00:47:42,472 --> 00:47:45,641
Make him squeal!

132
00:47:48,603 --> 00:47:49,853
Drop him!

133
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:52,022
You what?

134
00:47:52,023 --> 00:47:53,774
I said...

135
00:47:53,775 --> 00:47:55,025
...drop him.
