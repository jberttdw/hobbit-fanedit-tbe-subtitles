1
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:03,527
- Good morning.
What do you mean?

2
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:07,448
Do you wish me a good morning
or do you mean that it is a good morning...

3
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,825
...whether I want it or not'?

4
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:14,580
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good
on this particular morning?

5
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:19,581
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

6
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,172
All of them at once, I suppose.

7
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:28,173
Hmm.

8
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:30,012
Can I help you?

9
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:33,932
That remains to be seen.

10
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:38,933
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

11
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:44,693
An adventure?

12
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:49,694
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.

13
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:55,412
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

14
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:57,998
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

15
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:58,999
Mm.

16
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,085
Huh.

17
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,712
<i>Hmm.</i>

18
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:06,048
Oh. Ah.

19
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,383
Good morning.

20
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:10,469
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...

21
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,470
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.

22
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:17,768
Beg your pardon?

23
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,728
You've changed,
and not entirely for the better...

24
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:21,105
...Bilbo Baggins.

25
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,523
I'm sorry, do I know you?

26
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:25,859
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.

27
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,528
I'm Gandalf.

28
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,698
And Gandalf means...

29
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,450
...me.

30
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:35,702
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

31
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,204
...who made such excellent...

32
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:42,167
...fireworks? Old Took used to have them
on Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.

33
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:45,045
No idea you were still in business.

34
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:46,755
And where else should I be?

35
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:51,427
Where else--? Ahem.

36
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:55,472
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember
something about me...

37
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:59,017
...even if it's only my fireworks.

38
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:01,687
Yes. Well, that's decided.

39
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:05,065
It'll be very good for you...

40
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:06,900
...and most amusing for me.

41
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:08,735
I shall inform the others.

42
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:12,197
Inform the who? What? No. No. No-- Wait.

43
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:13,574
We do not want...

44
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:17,953
...any adventures here,
Thank you. Not today. Not--

45
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:22,954
I suggest you try Over the Hill
or Across the Water.

46
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:29,794
Good morning.
