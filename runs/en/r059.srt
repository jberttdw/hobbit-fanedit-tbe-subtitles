1
01:53:59,747 --> 01:54:01,556
Now there is only one.

2
01:54:04,187 --> 01:54:05,313
You need to reach...

3
01:54:05,547 --> 01:54:09,233
the mountain before
the last days of autumn.

4
01:54:09,467 --> 01:54:10,593
Before Durin's Day falls.

5
01:54:10,827 --> 01:54:11,794
Yes.

6
01:54:12,347 --> 01:54:13,917
You are running out of time.

7
01:54:14,147 --> 01:54:16,354
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

8
01:54:16,587 --> 01:54:19,397
A darkness lies upon that forest.

9
01:54:19,627 --> 01:54:22,676
Fell things creep beneath those trees.
