1
01:11:26,336 --> 01:11:27,628
Where's Bilbo?

2
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:28,879
Where's the Hobbit?

3
01:11:30,215 --> 01:11:34,468
There!

4
01:11:34,469 --> 01:11:36,720
Get him!

5
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:37,971
Aah!

6
01:11:37,972 --> 01:11:38,889
Grab my hand!

7
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:41,600
Bilbo!

8
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:42,893
Ori, be careful!

9
01:11:42,894 --> 01:11:44,269
Take it!

10
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,687
I've got you, lad.

11
01:11:45,688 --> 01:11:50,688
Grab on! Grab on!

12
01:11:56,908 --> 01:11:58,617
Come on.

13
01:11:58,618 --> 01:11:59,910
Get him.

14
01:11:59,911 --> 01:12:04,748
Come on, lad. Up you get.

15
01:12:04,749 --> 01:12:07,668
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

16
01:12:07,669 --> 01:12:11,046
He's been lost ever since he left home.

17
01:12:11,047 --> 01:12:13,131
He should never have come.

18
01:12:13,132 --> 01:12:16,927
He has no place amongst us.

19
01:12:16,928 --> 01:12:21,928
Dwalin!

20
01:12:24,644 --> 01:12:25,936
It looks safe enough.

21
01:12:25,937 --> 01:12:27,646
Search to the back.

22
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:32,647
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

23
01:12:33,945 --> 01:12:37,781
There's nothing here.

24
01:12:37,782 --> 01:12:40,075
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

25
01:12:40,076 --> 01:12:43,161
No. No fires. Not in this place.

26
01:12:43,162 --> 01:12:45,038
Get some sleep.

27
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:47,708
We start at first light.

28
01:12:47,709 --> 01:12:51,587
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

29
01:12:51,588 --> 01:12:53,130
That was the plan.

30
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:54,715
Plans change.

31
01:12:54,716 --> 01:12:58,927
Bofur, take the first watch.
