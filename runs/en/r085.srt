1
02:36:31,318 --> 02:36:32,399
This must be it.

2
02:36:34,598 --> 02:36:36,123
The hidden door.

3
02:36:40,358 --> 02:36:42,122
Let all those who doubted us...

4
02:36:43,278 --> 02:36:44,643
rue this day!

5
02:36:50,358 --> 02:36:52,804
Right, then. We have a key.

6
02:36:54,518 --> 02:36:56,008
Which means that somewhere...

7
02:36:57,118 --> 02:36:58,529
there is a key-hole.

8
02:36:59,238 --> 02:37:02,128
"The last light of Durin's Day...

9
02:37:04,118 --> 02:37:06,609
will shine upon...
...the key-hole."

10
02:37:15,758 --> 02:37:16,839
Nori.

11
02:37:23,438 --> 02:37:25,406
We're losing the light. Come on.

12
02:37:31,918 --> 02:37:34,524
Be quiet! I can't hear
when you're thumping.

13
02:37:34,758 --> 02:37:35,566
I can't find it.

14
02:37:36,998 --> 02:37:38,363
It's not here!

15
02:37:38,598 --> 02:37:39,679
It's not here!

16
02:37:41,438 --> 02:37:42,798
- Break it down!
- Aye.

17
02:37:44,518 --> 02:37:45,326
Come on!

18
02:37:47,478 --> 02:37:48,240
Break!

19
02:37:48,478 --> 02:37:49,479
It has to break.

20
02:37:50,438 --> 02:37:51,769
It's no good.

21
02:37:52,038 --> 02:37:54,518
The door's sealed. Can't
be opened by force.

22
02:37:56,158 --> 02:37:57,398
There's a powerful magic on it.

23
02:38:06,918 --> 02:38:08,044
No!

24
02:38:13,398 --> 02:38:15,685
"The last light of Durin's Day...

25
02:38:17,558 --> 02:38:19,128
will shine upon the key-hole."

26
02:38:23,558 --> 02:38:25,162
That is what it says.

27
02:38:29,638 --> 02:38:31,083
What did we miss?

28
02:38:35,038 --> 02:38:36,483
What did we miss?

29
02:38:37,518 --> 02:38:38,485
Balin?

30
02:38:39,118 --> 02:38:40,847
We've lost the light.

31
02:38:43,358 --> 02:38:45,201
There's no more to be done.

32
02:38:46,758 --> 02:38:47,327
We had but...

33
02:38:47,598 --> 02:38:48,838
one chance.

34
02:38:51,238 --> 02:38:52,524
Come away, lads.

35
02:38:52,758 --> 02:38:54,567
It's over.

36
02:38:55,638 --> 02:38:57,766
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.

37
02:39:00,278 --> 02:39:01,689
Where are they going?

38
02:39:03,478 --> 02:39:05,367
You can't give up now!

39
02:39:20,278 --> 02:39:21,439
Thorin.

40
02:39:23,478 --> 02:39:25,162
You can't give up now.

41
02:39:36,718 --> 02:39:39,085
"Stand by the gray stone...

42
02:39:40,958 --> 02:39:43,040
when the thrush knocks."

43
02:39:43,798 --> 02:39:45,209
The setting sun.

44
02:39:46,238 --> 02:39:49,128
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine..."

45
02:39:50,598 --> 02:39:52,088
The last light.

46
02:39:54,598 --> 02:39:56,009
Last light.

47
02:40:32,678 --> 02:40:33,918
The last light!

48
02:40:44,158 --> 02:40:45,284
The key-hole!

49
02:40:45,798 --> 02:40:46,367
Come back!

50
02:40:47,158 --> 02:40:48,489
Come back!

51
02:40:48,758 --> 02:40:50,920
It's the light of the moon! The last...

52
02:40:51,158 --> 02:40:54,241
moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!

53
02:40:56,158 --> 02:40:58,559
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the...?

54
02:40:58,798 --> 02:41:00,527
It was here.

55
02:41:00,758 --> 02:41:02,567
Come on, it was... It was here.

56
02:41:03,278 --> 02:41:04,086
It was just...

57
02:42:02,118 --> 02:42:03,563
Erebor.

58
02:42:04,278 --> 02:42:05,404
Thorin.

59
02:42:18,798 --> 02:42:20,687
I know these walls.

60
02:42:24,438 --> 02:42:25,963
These halls.

61
02:42:28,958 --> 02:42:30,369
This stone.

62
02:42:34,278 --> 02:42:36,284
You remember it... Balin.

63
02:42:39,878 --> 02:42:42,404
Chambers filled with golden light.

64
02:42:44,278 --> 02:42:45,768
I remember.

65
02:42:59,038 --> 02:43:00,369
"Herein lies...

66
02:43:00,638 --> 02:43:02,527
the Seventh Kingdom of...

67
02:43:02,758 --> 02:43:03,919
Durin's Folk.

68
02:43:05,878 --> 02:43:08,961
May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...

69
02:43:09,198 --> 02:43:12,805
Dwarves in defense of this home."

70
02:43:14,518 --> 02:43:16,361
The Throne of the King.

71
02:43:20,078 --> 02:43:23,400
And what's that above it?

72
02:43:26,958 --> 02:43:28,687
The Arkenstone.

73
02:43:29,998 --> 02:43:31,409
Arkenstone.

74
02:43:35,318 --> 02:43:36,683
And what's that?

75
02:43:36,998 --> 02:43:39,968
That, Master Burglar...

76
02:43:40,998 --> 02:43:43,046
is why you are here.
