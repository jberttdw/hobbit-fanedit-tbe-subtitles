1
01:57:32,948 --> 01:57:33,676
Not my horse!

2
01:57:33,908 --> 01:57:34,477
I need it!

3
01:57:36,908 --> 01:57:38,114
You're not leaving us?

4
01:57:38,348 --> 01:57:40,112
I would not do this unless I had to.

5
01:57:46,748 --> 01:57:48,034
You've changed...

6
01:57:48,308 --> 01:57:50,037
Bilbo Baggins.

7
01:57:51,428 --> 01:57:54,477
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

8
01:57:57,388 --> 01:57:58,958
I was going to tell you.

9
01:58:02,548 --> 01:58:03,674
I...

10
01:58:06,548 --> 01:58:08,630
found something in the Goblin tunnels.

11
01:58:08,908 --> 01:58:10,239
Found what?

12
01:58:14,988 --> 01:58:16,831
What did you find?

13
01:58:20,308 --> 01:58:21,548
My courage.

14
01:58:24,348 --> 01:58:26,396
Good. Well, that's good.

15
01:58:29,228 --> 01:58:31,037
You'll need it.

16
01:58:31,348 --> 01:58:33,919
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...

17
01:58:34,188 --> 01:58:35,314
the slopes of Erebor.

18
01:58:35,548 --> 01:58:37,915
Keep the map and key safe.

19
01:58:38,188 --> 01:58:41,158
Do not enter that mountain without me.

20
01:58:47,068 --> 01:58:50,311
This is not the Greenwood of old.
