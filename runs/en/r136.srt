1
03:52:29,961 --> 03:52:31,086
Fall back!

2
03:52:31,837 --> 03:52:32,878
Fall back...

3
03:52:33,129 --> 03:52:34,797
...to the Mountain!

4
03:52:37,510 --> 03:52:38,927
Fall back!

5
03:53:21,470 --> 03:53:23,012
I will not hide...

6
03:53:23,263 --> 03:53:24,597
...behind a wall of stone...

7
03:53:24,849 --> 03:53:27,766
...while others fight our battles for us!

8
03:53:31,480 --> 03:53:33,897
It is not in my blood, Thorin.

9
03:53:38,695 --> 03:53:40,070
No.

10
03:53:40,323 --> 03:53:41,739
It is not.

11
03:53:43,825 --> 03:53:46,035
We are sons of Durin.

12
03:53:49,039 --> 03:53:50,539
And Durin's Folk...

13
03:53:51,876 --> 03:53:54,336
...do not flee from a fight.

14
03:54:17,275 --> 03:54:21,154
I have no right to ask this of any of you.

15
03:54:26,159 --> 03:54:28,035
But will you follow me...

16
03:54:29,454 --> 03:54:31,163
...one last time?
