Fall back!

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

03:48:53,981 --> 03:48:57,235
DWALIN:
Since when do we forsake our own people?

5
03:48:57,786 --> 03:48:59,036
Thorin...

6
03:48:59,237 --> 03:49:01,356
They are dying out there.

7
03:49:06,994 --> 03:49:10,248
There are halls beneath
halls within this Mountain.

8
03:49:12,375 --> 03:49:14,502
Places we can fortify...

9
03:49:15,795 --> 03:49:18,840
...shore up, make safe, yes.

10
03:49:20,508 --> 03:49:21,509
Yes...

11
03:49:22,718 --> 03:49:23,968
...that is it.

12
03:49:24,679 --> 03:49:27,470
We must move the gold
further underground to safety.

13
03:49:27,670 --> 03:49:30,714
- Did you not hear me?
Dain is surrounded.

14
03:49:30,914 --> 03:49:32,624
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

15
03:49:35,189 --> 03:49:36,649
Many die in war.

16
03:49:37,900 --> 03:49:39,485
Life is cheap.

17
03:49:41,612 --> 03:49:43,643
But a treasure such as this...

18
03:49:44,314 --> 03:49:46,742
...cannot be counted in lives lost.

19
03:49:49,829 --> 03:49:51,330
It is worth...

20
03:49:51,581 --> 03:49:54,083
...all the blood we can spend.

21
03:49:55,751 --> 03:49:58,171
You sit here in these vast halls...

22
03:49:58,421 --> 03:50:00,882
...with a crown upon your head...

23
03:50:01,632 --> 03:50:04,719
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

24
03:50:06,554 --> 03:50:08,473
Do not speak to me...

25
03:50:10,141 --> 03:50:12,488
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...

26
03:50:14,061 --> 03:50:17,732

- <i>I am your king!</i>
- You were always my king.

30
03:50:29,827 --> 03:50:31,704
You used to know that once.

31
03:50:33,039 --> 03:50:35,625
You cannot see what you have become.

32
03:50:39,086 --> 03:50:40,296
Go.

33
03:50:43,049 --> 03:50:44,342
Get out.
