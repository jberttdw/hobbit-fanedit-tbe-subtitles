1
04:00:42,129 --> 04:00:43,379
It's Thorin.

2
04:00:43,881 --> 04:00:45,131
And Fili, Kili...

3
04:00:45,549 --> 04:00:46,925
...and Dwalin.

4
04:00:47,833 --> 04:00:49,970
He's taking his best warriors.

5
04:00:50,220 --> 04:00:51,470
To do what?

6
04:00:52,306 --> 04:00:54,683
To cut the head off the snake.

7
04:01:15,829 --> 04:01:16,638
[YELLS]

8
04:01:28,467 --> 04:01:29,217
Die!

9
04:01:36,475 --> 04:01:37,851
Gandalf!

10
04:01:38,560 --> 04:01:39,810
Legolas.

11
04:01:41,042 --> 04:01:42,564
Legolas Greenleaf!

12
04:01:42,814 --> 04:01:44,073
There is a second army.

13
04:01:44,274 --> 04:01:47,235
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.

14
04:01:47,486 --> 04:01:48,946
Gundabad.

15
04:01:50,155 --> 04:01:51,823
This was their plan all along.

16
04:01:54,163 --> 04:01:57,996
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.

17
04:01:58,246 --> 04:01:59,623
Wha--The North?

18
04:01:59,873 --> 04:02:01,325
Where is the North, exactly?

19
04:02:01,458 --> 04:02:03,543
Ravenhill.

20
04:02:04,753 --> 04:02:07,256
Ravenhill?
Thorin is up there.

21
04:02:07,484 --> 04:02:09,967
And Fili and Kili. They're all up there.
