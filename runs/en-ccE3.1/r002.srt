1
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,438
It began....

2
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:57,857
Well, it began as you might expect.

3
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,694
In a hole in the ground...

4
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:04,405
...there lived a Hobbit.

5
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:11,787
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.

6
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:14,123
This was a Hobbit hole.

7
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:19,587
And that means good food, a warm hearth...

8
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:22,757
...and all the comforts of home.
