1
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,766
Not with your companions?

2
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:55,399
Uh, no, I shan't be missed.

3
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:03,152
The truth is that most of them
don't think I should be on this journey.

4
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:05,863
Indeed?

5
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:09,358
I've heard that Hobbits are very resilient.

6
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,080
Really?

7
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,031
ELROND:
Mm.

8
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:24,570
I've also heard they're
fond of the comforts of home.

9
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:30,879
I've heard that it's unwise
to seek the council of Elves.

10
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,674
That they will answer with yes and no.

11
01:07:39,407 --> 01:07:40,657
[LAUGHS]

12
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:47,434
You are very welcome to stay here,
if that is your wish.
