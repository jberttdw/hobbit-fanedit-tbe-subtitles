1
02:43:44,871 --> 02:43:48,416
You want me to find a jewel?

2
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:51,670
A large, white jewel.

3
02:43:52,128 --> 02:43:53,254
Yes.

4
02:43:54,631 --> 02:43:57,217
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

5
02:43:57,550 --> 02:44:00,762
There is only one Arkenstone...

6
02:44:01,513 --> 02:44:03,598
...and you'll know it when you see it.

7
02:44:04,724 --> 02:44:05,850
Right.

8
02:44:09,604 --> 02:44:11,314
In truth, lad...

9
02:44:12,107 --> 02:44:14,150
I do not know...

10
02:44:14,401 --> 02:44:16,486
...what you will find down there.

11
02:44:18,613 --> 02:44:21,741
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

12
02:44:21,991 --> 02:44:22,951
No, Balin.

13
02:44:24,202 --> 02:44:26,246
I promised I would do this...

14
02:44:26,913 --> 02:44:28,623
...and I think I must try.

15
02:44:30,291 --> 02:44:31,835
[CHUCKLES]

16
02:44:33,336 --> 02:44:35,046
It never ceases to amaze me.

17
02:44:35,296 --> 02:44:36,089
What's that?

18
02:44:36,339 --> 02:44:38,049
The courage of Hobbits.

19
02:44:40,427 --> 02:44:41,678
Go now...

20
02:44:42,178 --> 02:44:46,182
...with as much luck as you can muster.

21
02:44:53,398 --> 02:44:54,691
Oh, Bilbo?

22
02:44:57,110 --> 02:44:59,404
If there is, in fact...

23
02:45:00,905 --> 02:45:03,032
...a live dragon down there?

24
02:45:06,077 --> 02:45:07,495
Don't waken it.
