1
03:20:20,978 --> 03:20:23,438
...why should I honor such terms?

2
03:20:25,607 --> 03:20:27,567
Because you gave us your word.

3
03:20:31,822 --> 03:20:33,991
Does that mean nothing?

4
03:20:48,547 --> 03:20:49,797
Be gone!

5
03:20:50,590 --> 03:20:52,843
Ere our arrows fly!

[GRUNTS]

7
03:21:10,861 --> 03:21:12,154
BILBO:
What are you doing?

8
03:21:13,697 --> 03:21:16,366
You cannot go to war.

9
03:21:17,534 --> 03:21:19,828
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...

10
03:21:20,078 --> 03:21:23,540
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.

11
03:21:23,790 --> 03:21:26,585
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

12
03:21:27,243 --> 03:21:28,920
We are, in fact, outnumbered.

13
03:21:31,590 --> 03:21:33,125
Not for much longer.

14
03:21:34,343 --> 03:21:35,594
What does that mean?

15
03:21:35,844 --> 03:21:37,596
It means, Master Baggins...

16
03:21:40,640 --> 03:21:42,976
...you should never underestimate Dwarves.

17
03:21:46,688 --> 03:21:48,482
We have reclaimed Erebor.

18
03:21:49,733 --> 03:21:50,984
Now...

19
03:21:51,234 --> 03:21:52,819
...we defend it.

20
03:22:10,670 --> 03:22:12,506
He will give us nothing.

21
03:22:14,249 --> 03:22:18,762
- Such a pity. Still, you tried.
- I do not understand.

22
03:22:19,971 --> 03:22:21,056
Why?

23
03:22:21,807 --> 03:22:23,308
Why would he risk war?

03:22:23,722 --> 03:22:25,853
[GRUNTING]

25
03:22:36,738 --> 03:22:39,032
It is fruitless to reason with them.

26
03:22:39,282 --> 03:22:41,868
They understand only one thing.

27
03:22:45,831 --> 03:22:47,081
We attack at dawn.

28
03:22:50,252 --> 03:22:51,753
Are you with us?

29
03:23:23,298 --> 03:23:24,161
Aye.

30
03:23:28,415 --> 03:23:30,834
THORIN:
Master Baggins, come here.

31
03:23:48,059 --> 03:23:49,769
You're going to need this.

32
03:23:51,271 --> 03:23:52,522
Put it on.

33
03:23:57,527 --> 03:24:00,280
This vest is made of silver steel.

34
03:24:02,782 --> 03:24:06,578
"Mithril", it was called by my forebears.

35
03:24:09,706 --> 03:24:11,791
No blade can pierce it.

36
03:24:23,371 --> 03:24:26,348
I look absurd.
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

37
03:24:26,598 --> 03:24:28,058
It is a gift.

38
03:24:29,601 --> 03:24:31,144
A token of our friendship.

39
03:24:34,522 --> 03:24:36,900
True friends are hard to come by.

40
03:24:38,568 --> 03:24:40,237
I have been blind...

41
03:24:40,487 --> 03:24:42,364
...but now I begin to see.

42
03:24:43,740 --> 03:24:45,242
I am betrayed.

43
03:24:46,576 --> 03:24:47,953
Betrayed?

44
03:24:48,495 --> 03:24:50,330
The Arkenstone.

45
03:24:59,798 --> 03:25:01,299
One of them has taken it.

46
03:25:08,556 --> 03:25:11,434
One of them is false.

47
03:25:12,477 --> 03:25:13,727
Thorin...

48
03:25:14,479 --> 03:25:19,109
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain. Is that not enough?

49
03:25:19,359 --> 03:25:21,861
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...

50
03:25:22,529 --> 03:25:26,199
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.

51
03:25:26,449 --> 03:25:30,453
Now, is this treasure
truly worth more than your honor?

52
03:25:30,704 --> 03:25:33,123
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.

53
03:25:33,790 --> 03:25:35,625
For that, I am grateful.

54
03:25:35,875 --> 03:25:39,462
It was nobly done, but the treasure
in this mountain does not belong...

55
03:25:39,806 --> 03:25:41,131
...to the people of Lake-town.

56
03:25:41,381 --> 03:25:42,631
This gold...

57
03:25:46,428 --> 03:25:47,971
...is ours.

58
03:25:51,141 --> 03:25:52,392
And ours alone.

59
03:25:55,895 --> 03:25:57,480
By my life...

60
03:25:58,398 --> 03:26:01,318
...I will not part...

61
03:26:02,068 --> 03:26:05,363
...with a single coin.

62
03:26:07,032 --> 03:26:08,658
Not...

63
03:26:09,659 --> 03:26:11,161
...one...

64
03:26:11,745 --> 03:26:13,747
...piece of it.
