1
03:29:08,741 --> 03:29:12,161
GANDALF: Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?

2
03:29:12,411 --> 03:29:14,079
What do you think I'm trying to do?

3
03:29:14,330 --> 03:29:16,800
I think you're trying to
save your Dwarvish friends...

4
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:19,335
...and I admire your loyalty to them...

5
03:29:19,585 --> 03:29:22,338
...but it does not dissuade
me from my course.

6
03:29:23,130 --> 03:29:25,507
You started this, Mithrandir.

7
03:29:26,091 --> 03:29:29,053
You will forgive me if I finish it.

8
03:29:29,303 --> 03:29:31,013
Are the archers in position?

9
03:29:31,889 --> 03:29:34,099
FEREN: Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.

10
03:29:34,725 --> 03:29:36,977
If anything moves on that Mountain...

11
03:29:37,228 --> 03:29:38,478
...kill it.

12
03:29:41,315 --> 03:29:43,609
The Dwarves are out of time.

13
03:30:10,412 --> 03:30:11,662
You, Bowman!

14
03:30:12,763 --> 03:30:16,308
Do you agree with this?
Is gold so important to you?

15
03:30:17,101 --> 03:30:19,603
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?

16
03:30:20,152 --> 03:30:21,404
It will not come to that.

17
03:30:21,605 --> 03:30:24,358
- This is a fight they cannot win.
BILBO: That won't stop them.

18
03:30:24,608 --> 03:30:27,524
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.

19
03:30:27,725 --> 03:30:29,621
They will fight to the
death to defend their own.

20
03:30:29,822 --> 03:30:31,282
Bilbo Baggins.

21
03:30:31,824 --> 03:30:35,606
THRANDUIL: If I'm not mistaken
this is the Halfling who stole the keys...

22
03:30:35,807 --> 03:30:39,707
...to my dungeons from
under the nose of my guards.

23
03:30:42,209 --> 03:30:43,294
<i>Yes.</i>

24
03:30:44,295 --> 03:30:46,463
Sorry about that.

25
03:30:47,716 --> 03:30:48,966
I came...

26
03:30:49,758 --> 03:30:52,011
...to give you this.

27
03:30:56,765 --> 03:30:58,642
The Heart of the Mountain.

28
03:31:00,395 --> 03:31:01,895
The King's Jewel.

29
03:31:03,355 --> 03:31:05,357
And worth a king's ransom.

30
03:31:07,276 --> 03:31:09,403
How is this yours to give?

31
03:31:09,653 --> 03:31:11,655
I took it as my 14th
share of the treasure.

32
03:31:13,282 --> 03:31:15,909
BARD: Why would you do this?
You owe us no loyalty.

33
03:31:16,160 --> 03:31:17,870
I'm not doing it for you.

34
03:31:19,639 --> 03:31:21,957
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate...

35
03:31:22,458 --> 03:31:23,751
...and pigheaded and...

36
03:31:24,460 --> 03:31:25,635
...difficult.

37
03:31:25,836 --> 03:31:27,629
They're suspicious and secretive...

38
03:31:27,880 --> 03:31:31,717
...with the worst manners you can
possibly imagine, but they are also brave...

39
03:31:31,967 --> 03:31:33,218
...and kind...

40
03:31:34,803 --> 03:31:36,138
...and loyal to a fault.

41
03:31:37,306 --> 03:31:41,101
I've grown very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.

42
03:31:41,935 --> 03:31:45,481
Now, Thorin values
this stone above all else.

43
03:31:45,731 --> 03:31:49,443
In exchange for its return, I believe
he will give you what you are owed.

44
03:31:49,693 --> 03:31:51,820
There will be no need for war.

45
03:31:58,051 --> 03:32:00,790
GANDALF: Rest up tonight.
You must leave on the morrow.

46
03:32:00,997 --> 03:32:02,976
- Wha...?
- Get as far away from here as possible.

47
03:32:03,177 --> 03:32:04,355
- I--I'm not leaving.

48
03:32:04,556 --> 03:32:07,389
You picked me as the 14th man. I'm
not about to leave the Company now.

49
03:32:07,590 --> 03:32:09,582
- There is no Company. Not anymore.

50
03:32:09,783 --> 03:32:12,762
And I don't like to think what Thorin will
do when he finds out what you've done.

51
03:32:12,963 --> 03:32:14,267
- I'm not afraid of Thorin.

52
03:32:14,468 --> 03:32:15,761
Well, you should be.

53
03:32:16,345 --> 03:32:19,515
Don't underestimate the evil of gold.

54
03:32:19,765 --> 03:32:23,102
Gold over which a serpent has long brooded.

55
03:32:23,352 --> 03:32:27,815
Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts
of all who come near this Mountain.

56
03:32:29,441 --> 03:32:31,286
Almost all. Heh.
