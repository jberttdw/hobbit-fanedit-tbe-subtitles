1
02:55:00,099 --> 02:55:03,102
I will not part with a single coin.

2
02:55:03,769 --> 02:55:06,313
Not one piece of it.

3
02:55:10,192 --> 02:55:12,486
My teeth are swords.

4
02:55:13,404 --> 02:55:16,699
My claws are spears.

5
02:55:18,826 --> 02:55:23,163
My wings are a hurricane!

6
02:55:28,794 --> 02:55:30,629
So it is true.

7
02:55:31,005 --> 02:55:33,132
The Black Arrow found its mark.

8
02:55:33,382 --> 02:55:34,545
What did you say?

9
02:55:35,134 --> 02:55:39,290
Uh--I--I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug the--

10
02:55:39,668 --> 02:55:40,758
...Tyrannical.

11
02:55:41,056 --> 02:55:42,141
Truly.

12
02:55:42,401 --> 02:55:45,144
You have no equal on this earth.

13
02:55:48,772 --> 02:55:52,943
I am almost tempted to let you take it.
