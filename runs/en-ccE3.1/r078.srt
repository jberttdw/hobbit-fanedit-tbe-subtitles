1
02:56:35,527 --> 02:56:36,779
What about Bilbo?

2
02:56:37,030 --> 02:56:38,285
THORIN: Give him more time.

3
02:56:38,702 --> 02:56:40,981
BALIN: Time to do what? To be killed?

4
02:56:42,910 --> 02:56:44,162
You're afraid.

5
02:56:45,830 --> 02:56:48,124
Yes, I'm afraid.

6
02:56:49,292 --> 02:56:50,627
I fear for you.

7
02:56:52,003 --> 02:56:54,172
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

8
02:56:54,589 --> 02:56:56,924
A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.

9
02:56:57,175 --> 02:56:58,760
I am not my grandfather.

10
02:56:59,010 --> 02:57:00,762
- You're not yourself.

11
02:57:01,491 --> 02:57:03,765
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there--

12
02:57:04,015 --> 02:57:08,645
THORIN: I will not risk this
quest for the life of one <i>burglar</i>.

13
02:57:10,521 --> 02:57:11,940
Bilbo.

14
02:57:12,315 --> 02:57:14,233
His name is Bilbo.
