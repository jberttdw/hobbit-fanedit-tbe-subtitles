1
03:12:54,746 --> 03:12:55,996
BOFUR:
Up it goes!

2
03:12:59,108 --> 03:13:00,358
DWALIN:
That's it.

3
03:13:03,863 --> 03:13:06,073
I want this fortress made safe by sunup.

4
03:13:06,949 --> 03:13:08,492
This Mountain was hard-won.

5
03:13:08,743 --> 03:13:10,661
I will not see it taken again.

6
03:13:10,911 --> 03:13:13,039
The people of Lake-town have nothing.

7
03:13:13,289 --> 03:13:14,665
They came to us in need.

8
03:13:14,915 --> 03:13:17,376
They have lost everything.

9
03:13:17,627 --> 03:13:20,755
Do not tell me what they have lost.

10
03:13:21,631 --> 03:13:24,050
I know well enough their hardship.

11
03:13:25,468 --> 03:13:29,138
Those who have lived through
dragon fire should rejoice!

12
03:13:30,473 --> 03:13:32,892
They have much
to be grateful for.

13
03:13:38,204 --> 03:13:39,459
More stone.

14
03:13:42,234 --> 03:13:44,362
Bring more stone to the gate!

15
03:13:44,612 --> 03:13:45,862
DWALIN:
That's it.
