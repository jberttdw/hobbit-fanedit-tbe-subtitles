1
02:57:39,504 --> 02:57:44,426
You think you can deceive me,
Barrel-rider?

2
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:49,263
You have come from Lake-town.

3
02:57:50,973 --> 02:57:55,770
This is some sordid scheme
hatched between these filthy Dwarves...

4
02:57:56,020 --> 02:57:59,190
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

5
02:58:00,191 --> 02:58:02,109
<i>Those sniveling cowards...</i>

6
02:58:02,360 --> 02:58:06,906
<i>...with their long bows and Black Arrows.</i>

7
02:58:07,281 --> 02:58:11,285
Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit.

8
02:58:11,828 --> 02:58:13,079
Oh, no.

9
02:58:14,956 --> 02:58:16,415
This isn't their fault!

10
02:58:16,666 --> 02:58:19,293
Wait!
You cannot go to Lake-town!

11
02:58:21,212 --> 02:58:25,341
You care about them, do you?

12
02:58:25,591 --> 02:58:26,651
Good.

13
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:29,679
Then you can watch them die.
