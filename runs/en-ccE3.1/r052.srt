1
01:53:59,447 --> 01:54:01,241
Now there is only one.

2
01:54:03,869 --> 01:54:08,915
You need to reach the mountain
before the last days of autumn.

3
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:11,501
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.

4
01:54:12,043 --> 01:54:13,587
You are running out of time.

5
01:54:13,837 --> 01:54:16,047
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

6
01:54:16,298 --> 01:54:19,092
A darkness lies upon that forest.

7
01:54:19,342 --> 01:54:22,345
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

8
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:26,183
There is an alliance
between the Orcs of Moria...

9
01:54:26,433 --> 01:54:29,311
...and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

10
01:54:29,561 --> 01:54:33,773
I would not venture there,
except in great need.

11
01:54:34,024 --> 01:54:37,027
We will take the Elven Road.
That path is still safe.

12
01:54:37,277 --> 01:54:38,236
BEORN:
"Safe"?

13
01:54:38,695 --> 01:54:41,239
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood
are not like their kin.

14
01:54:41,865 --> 01:54:45,452
They're less wise and more dangerous.

15
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,497
But it matters not.

16
01:54:50,415 --> 01:54:51,500
What do you mean?

17
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:54,502
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

18
01:54:55,253 --> 01:54:57,964
Their numbers are growing.

19
01:54:58,215 --> 01:54:59,674
And you are on foot.

20
01:55:00,592 --> 01:55:03,845
You will never reach the forest alive.

21
01:55:08,308 --> 01:55:10,644
I don't like Dwarves.

22
01:55:11,645 --> 01:55:13,313
They're greedy--

23
01:55:14,022 --> 01:55:15,272
...and blind.

24
01:55:16,025 --> 01:55:20,612
Blind to the lives of those
they deem lesser than their own.

25
01:55:27,744 --> 01:55:29,996
But Orcs I hate more.

26
01:55:31,831 --> 01:55:33,500
What do you need?

27
01:55:38,797 --> 01:55:41,591
BEORN:
Go now. While you have the light.
