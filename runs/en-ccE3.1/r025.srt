1
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:16,484
GREAT GOBLIN [SINGING]:
Bones will be shattered

2
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:17,990
Necks will be wrung

3
01:19:18,191 --> 01:19:19,988
You'll be beaten and battered

4
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,573
From racks you'll be hung

5
01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:26,036
You will die down here
And never be found

6
01:19:26,236 --> 01:19:30,322
Down in the deep of Goblin-town

7
01:19:33,243 --> 01:19:37,204
I know that sword!
It is the Goblin-cleaver!

8
01:19:37,831 --> 01:19:39,123
The Biter!

9
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:42,803
The blade that sliced a thousand necks!

10
01:19:43,003 --> 01:19:46,890
Slash them! Beat them! Kill them!

11
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:48,799
Kill them all!
