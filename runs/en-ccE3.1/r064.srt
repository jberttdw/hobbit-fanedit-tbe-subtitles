1
02:20:40,132 --> 02:20:41,382
BARD:
Do it again...

2
02:20:41,842 --> 02:20:43,092
...and you're dead.

3
02:20:45,638 --> 02:20:46,897
BALIN:
Excuse me...

4
02:20:47,098 --> 02:20:50,226
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

5
02:20:51,185 --> 02:20:53,688
That barge over there...

6
02:20:53,938 --> 02:20:57,233
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

7
02:20:58,901 --> 02:21:00,986
What makes you think I would help you?

8
02:21:01,237 --> 02:21:03,072
Those boots have seen better days.

9
02:21:03,656 --> 02:21:05,199
As has that coat.

10
02:21:06,283 --> 02:21:08,244
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

11
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:10,788
How many bairns?

12
02:21:11,706 --> 02:21:13,332
A boy and two girls.

13
02:21:14,333 --> 02:21:16,877
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

14
02:21:18,005 --> 02:21:19,255
BARD:
Aye.

15
02:21:19,714 --> 02:21:20,964
She was.

16
02:21:24,009 --> 02:21:25,511
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

17
02:21:25,761 --> 02:21:28,693
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

18
02:21:29,306 --> 02:21:30,482
What's your hurry?

19
02:21:30,683 --> 02:21:31,937
What's it to you?

20
02:21:32,226 --> 02:21:33,873
I would like to know who you are...

21
02:21:34,934 --> 02:21:36,613
...and what you are doing in these lands.

22
02:21:36,814 --> 02:21:39,316
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

23
02:21:39,692 --> 02:21:42,987
...journeying to see our kin
in the Iron Hills.

24
02:21:44,363 --> 02:21:46,323
Simple merchants, you say?

25
02:21:46,574 --> 02:21:47,908
We need food...

26
02:21:48,159 --> 02:21:50,119
...supplies, weapons.

27
02:21:50,369 --> 02:21:51,619
Can you help us?

28
02:21:56,041 --> 02:21:58,335
BARD:
I know where these barrels came from.

29
02:21:59,086 --> 02:22:00,337
What of it?

30
02:22:00,588 --> 02:22:03,007
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

31
02:22:03,549 --> 02:22:05,259
...but I don't think it ended well.

32
02:22:06,927 --> 02:22:09,805
No one enters Lake-town
but by leave of the Master.

33
02:22:10,514 --> 02:22:13,225
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

34
02:22:13,476 --> 02:22:16,644
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

35
02:22:18,189 --> 02:22:19,439
Offer him more.

36
02:22:22,589 --> 02:22:25,090
BALIN: I'll wager there are
ways to enter that town unseen.

37
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:26,864
Aye.

38
02:22:28,199 --> 02:22:29,450
But for that...

39
02:22:30,659 --> 02:22:32,036
...you would need a smuggler.

40
02:22:32,286 --> 02:22:34,205
For which we would pay double.
