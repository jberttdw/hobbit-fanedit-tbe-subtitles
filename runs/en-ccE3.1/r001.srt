My dear Frodo:

2
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:17,710
You asked me once if I had told you
everything there was to know about my...

3
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,483
<i>...adventures.</i>

4
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:23,468
And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...

5
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,972
...I may not have told you all of it.

6
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:37,065
I am old now, Frodo.

7
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:41,319
I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.

8
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:49,087
I think it is time for you to know...

9
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,955
...what really happened.
