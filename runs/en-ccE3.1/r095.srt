1
03:07:02,169 --> 03:07:04,004
We must look to our own.

2
03:07:04,588 --> 03:07:07,049
To the sick and the helpless.

3
03:07:07,674 --> 03:07:10,093
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.

4
03:07:10,344 --> 03:07:12,478
And those who have strength left, follow me.

5
03:07:12,679 --> 03:07:14,139
We must salvage what we can.

6
03:07:14,389 --> 03:07:16,186
And what then? What'll we do then?

7
03:07:20,646 --> 03:07:22,147
We find shelter.
