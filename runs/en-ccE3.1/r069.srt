1
02:26:35,541 --> 02:26:38,086
Da! Where have you been?

2
02:26:38,336 --> 02:26:41,297
Father! There you are! I was worried.

3
02:26:41,672 --> 02:26:43,049
Here, Sigrid.

4
02:26:43,633 --> 02:26:44,924
<i>Bain, get them in.</i>

5
02:26:52,350 --> 02:26:56,646
If you speak of this to anyone,
I'll rip your arms off.

6
02:26:59,524 --> 02:27:00,983
Get off.

7
02:27:02,234 --> 02:27:03,528
Up there.

8
02:27:11,285 --> 02:27:14,580
SIGRID: Da... Why are there
dwarves climbing out of our toilet?

9
02:27:14,831 --> 02:27:16,165
Will they bring us luck?

10
02:27:20,753 --> 02:27:23,589
They may not be the best fit,
but they'll keep you warm.

11
02:27:24,111 --> 02:27:25,291
Thank you very much.

12
02:27:35,518 --> 02:27:37,603
A Dwarvish windlance.

13
02:27:38,558 --> 02:27:40,138
You look like you've seen a ghost.

14
02:27:40,773 --> 02:27:41,941
He has.

15
02:27:42,733 --> 02:27:45,653
The last time we saw such a weapon...

16
02:27:46,696 --> 02:27:48,469
...a city was on fire.

17
02:27:49,615 --> 02:27:51,868
It was the day the dragon came.

18
02:27:52,660 --> 02:27:53,828
[PEOPLE SCREAMING]

19
02:27:55,121 --> 02:27:57,957
<i>The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.</i>

20
02:28:00,418 --> 02:28:02,628
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

21
02:28:02,879 --> 02:28:05,006
<i>...rallied his bowmen
to fire upon the beast.</i>

22
02:28:06,132 --> 02:28:07,884
But a dragon's hide is tough.

23
02:28:08,467 --> 02:28:10,636
Tougher than the strongest armor.

24
02:28:10,887 --> 02:28:14,056
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

25
02:28:14,307 --> 02:28:16,274
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

26
02:28:16,851 --> 02:28:19,937
<i>And few of those arrows were ever made.</i>

27
02:28:25,276 --> 02:28:29,202
<i>The store was running low
when Girion made his last stand.</i>

28
02:28:36,704 --> 02:28:40,124
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

29
02:28:40,708 --> 02:28:42,543
...much would have been different.

30
02:28:46,672 --> 02:28:48,591
You speak as if you were there.

31
02:28:49,967 --> 02:28:52,053
All Dwarves know the tale.

32
02:28:52,386 --> 02:28:54,597
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

33
02:28:54,847 --> 02:28:56,724
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

34
02:28:56,974 --> 02:28:59,112
One more shot and he
would have killed the beast.

35
02:28:59,313 --> 02:29:02,063
[DWALIN CHUCKLES]
That's a fairy story, lad.

36
02:29:02,313 --> 02:29:03,689
Nothing more.

37
02:29:04,690 --> 02:29:06,067
You took our money.

38
02:29:07,151 --> 02:29:08,444
Where are the weapons?
