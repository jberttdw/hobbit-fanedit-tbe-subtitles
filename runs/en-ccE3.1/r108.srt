[DWARVES SHOUTING]

03:33:51,133 --> 03:33:52,606
We have come to tell you...

4
03:33:52,857 --> 03:33:56,110
...payment of your debt has been offered...

5
03:33:56,360 --> 03:33:57,820
...and accepted.

6
03:33:59,280 --> 03:34:00,530
THORIN:
What payment?

7
03:34:01,449 --> 03:34:02,741
I gave you nothing.

8
03:34:03,492 --> 03:34:05,244
You have nothing.

9
03:34:12,168 --> 03:34:13,627
We have this.

10
03:34:17,506 --> 03:34:18,924
KILI:
They have the Arkenstone.

11
03:34:20,551 --> 03:34:21,677
Thieves!

12
03:34:22,303 --> 03:34:25,431
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?

13
03:34:25,681 --> 03:34:27,742
That stone belongs to the king!

14
03:34:28,767 --> 03:34:30,019
And the king may have it...

15
03:34:30,895 --> 03:34:32,396
...with our goodwill.

16
03:34:37,318 --> 03:34:41,280
But first he must honor his word.

17
03:34:43,741 --> 03:34:45,451
They are taking us for fools.

18
03:34:47,161 --> 03:34:48,537
This is a ruse.

19
03:34:50,122 --> 03:34:51,874
A filthy lie.

20
03:34:53,209 --> 03:34:56,128
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!

21
03:34:56,378 --> 03:34:57,554
It is a trick!

22
03:34:57,755 --> 03:34:59,381
BILBO:
It--It is no trick.

23
03:35:00,549 --> 03:35:01,842
The stone is real.

24
03:35:03,385 --> 03:35:04,970
I gave it to them.

25
03:35:13,187 --> 03:35:14,021
You?

26
03:35:16,565 --> 03:35:18,776
I took it as my 14th share.

27
03:35:20,653 --> 03:35:22,488
You would steal from me?

28
03:35:22,738 --> 03:35:24,636
Steal from you? No. No.

29
03:35:24,837 --> 03:35:27,579
I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.

30
03:35:30,579 --> 03:35:32,498
I'll let it stand against my claim.

31
03:35:32,998 --> 03:35:34,792
Against your claim?

32
03:35:36,544 --> 03:35:38,212
Your claim.

33
03:35:39,088 --> 03:35:42,891
You have no claim over me,
you miserable <i>rat!</i>

34
03:35:44,593 --> 03:35:46,470
I was going to give it to you.

35
03:35:47,471 --> 03:35:49,636
Many times I wanted to, but...

36
03:35:49,979 --> 03:35:51,976
- But what, thief?

37
03:35:52,323 --> 03:35:54,478
- You are changed, Thorin.

38
03:35:54,728 --> 03:35:58,857
The Dwarf I met in Bag End would
never have gone back on his word.

39
03:35:59,784 --> 03:36:02,152
Would never have doubted
the loyalty of his kin!

40
03:36:02,903 --> 03:36:05,155
Do not speak to me...

41
03:36:05,864 --> 03:36:07,199
...of loyalty.

42
03:36:10,786 --> 03:36:12,408
Throw him from the rampart!

43
03:36:21,297 --> 03:36:22,894
Did you not hear me?

44
03:36:25,926 --> 03:36:28,230
I will do it myself. Curse you!

45
03:36:28,456 --> 03:36:29,555
No!

46
03:36:29,805 --> 03:36:32,164
Cursed be the Wizard that
forced you on this company!

47
03:36:32,414 --> 03:36:36,395
- If you don't like my burglar
then please, don't damage him.

48
03:36:36,645 --> 03:36:38,645
Return him to me.

49
03:36:42,735 --> 03:36:48,949
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain, are you...

50
03:36:49,443 --> 03:36:52,244
... Thorin, son of Thrain?

51
03:36:58,673 --> 03:37:01,378
THORIN: Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!

52
03:37:01,629 --> 03:37:02,262
- Go!

53
03:37:02,463 --> 03:37:03,719
- Or Shire rats!

BARD:
Are we resolved?

55
03:37:10,971 --> 03:37:14,183
The return of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?

56
03:37:20,481 --> 03:37:22,191
Give us your answer.

57
03:37:23,442 --> 03:37:25,027
Will you have peace...

58
03:37:26,779 --> 03:37:28,113
