1
03:20:21,378 --> 03:20:23,838
...why should I honor such terms?

2
03:20:26,007 --> 03:20:27,967
Because you gave us your word.

3
03:20:32,222 --> 03:20:34,391
Does that mean nothing?

4
03:20:48,947 --> 03:20:50,115
Be gone!

5
03:20:50,990 --> 03:20:51,866
Ere our arrows...

03:20:52,117 --> 03:20:53,243
...fly!

BILBO:
What are you doing?

9
03:21:14,097 --> 03:21:16,766
You cannot go to war.

10
03:21:17,934 --> 03:21:20,228
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...

11
03:21:20,478 --> 03:21:23,940
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.

12
03:21:24,190 --> 03:21:26,985
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

13
03:21:27,861 --> 03:21:29,320
We are, in fact, outnumbered.

14
03:21:31,990 --> 03:21:33,199
Not for much longer.

15
03:21:34,993 --> 03:21:35,994
What does that mean?

16
03:21:36,244 --> 03:21:37,996
It means, Master Baggins...

17
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:43,376
...you should never underestimate Dwarves.

18
03:21:47,088 --> 03:21:48,882
We have reclaimed Erebor.

19
03:21:50,133 --> 03:21:51,384
Now...

20
03:21:51,634 --> 03:21:53,219
...we defend it.

21
03:22:11,070 --> 03:22:12,906
He will give us nothing.

22
03:22:14,324 --> 03:22:15,533
Such a pity.

23
03:22:15,783 --> 03:22:16,409
Still...

24
03:22:16,659 --> 03:22:19,162
- ...you tried.
- I do not understand.

25
03:22:20,371 --> 03:22:21,456
Why?

26
03:22:22,207 --> 03:22:23,708
Why would he risk war?

28
03:22:37,138 --> 03:22:39,432
It is fruitless to reason with them.

29
03:22:39,682 --> 03:22:40,683
They understand...

30
03:22:40,934 --> 03:22:42,268
...only one thing.

31
03:22:46,231 --> 03:22:47,440
We attack at dawn.

Are you with us?

33
03:23:23,935 --> 03:23:24,561
Aye.

03:23:28,815 --> 03:23:31,234
THORIN:
Master Baggins, come here.

35
03:23:48,459 --> 03:23:50,169
You're going to need this.

36
03:23:51,671 --> 03:23:52,922
Put it on.

37
03:23:57,927 --> 03:24:00,680
This vest is made of silver steel.

03:24:04,809 --> 03:24:06,978
...it was called by my forebears.

03:24:10,106 --> 03:24:12,191
No blade can pierce it.

41
03:24:23,494 --> 03:24:24,495
I look absurd.

42
03:24:24,746 --> 03:24:26,748
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

43
03:24:26,998 --> 03:24:28,458
It is a gift.

44
03:24:30,001 --> 03:24:31,544
A token of our friendship.

45
03:24:34,922 --> 03:24:37,300
True friends are hard to come by.

46
03:24:38,968 --> 03:24:40,637
I have been blind...

47
03:24:40,887 --> 03:24:42,764
...but now I begin to see.

48
03:24:44,140 --> 03:24:45,642
I am betrayed.

49
03:24:46,976 --> 03:24:48,353
Betrayed?

The Arkenstone.

51
03:25:00,198 --> 03:25:01,699
One of them has taken it.

52
03:25:08,956 --> 03:25:11,834
One of them is false.

03:25:12,877 --> 03:25:14,045
Thorin...

54
03:25:14,879 --> 03:25:18,049
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain.

03:25:18,299 --> 03:25:19,509
Is that not enough?

56
03:25:19,759 --> 03:25:22,261
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...

57
03:25:22,929 --> 03:25:26,599
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.

58
03:25:26,849 --> 03:25:28,101
Now, is this treasure...

59
03:25:28,351 --> 03:25:30,853
...truly worth more than your honor?

60
03:25:31,104 --> 03:25:33,523
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.

61
03:25:34,190 --> 03:25:36,025
For that, I am grateful.

62
03:25:36,275 --> 03:25:38,111
It was nobly done, but the treasure...

63
03:25:38,361 --> 03:25:40,029
...does not belong to the people...

64
03:25:40,279 --> 03:25:41,531
...of Lake-town.

65
03:25:41,781 --> 03:25:42,699
This gold...

66
03:25:46,828 --> 03:25:48,371
...is ours.

67
03:25:51,541 --> 03:25:52,792
And ours alone.

03:25:56,295 --> 03:25:57,880
By my life...

03:25:58,798 --> 03:26:01,718
...I will not part...

70
03:26:02,468 --> 03:26:05,763
...with a single coin.

71
03:26:07,432 --> 03:26:09,058
Not...

72
03:26:10,059 --> 03:26:11,561
...one...

...piece of it.
