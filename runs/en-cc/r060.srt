02:15:48,784 --> 02:15:51,495
ELROS: Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

2
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:55,124
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

3
02:15:55,374 --> 02:15:57,418
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

4
02:15:57,668 --> 02:16:02,340
GALION: Say what you like about our ill-
tempered king. He has excellent taste in wine.

5
02:16:03,341 --> 02:16:04,842
Come, Elros, try it.

6
02:16:05,551 --> 02:16:07,637
ELROS: I have the
Dwarves in my charge.

7
02:16:08,054 --> 02:16:10,973
GALION:
They're locked up. Where can they go? Ha, ha.

8
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:16,604
BOFUR:
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

9
02:16:16,854 --> 02:16:18,564
Must be nearly dawn.

10
02:16:18,814 --> 02:16:21,108
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

11
02:16:24,070 --> 02:16:26,155
Not stuck in here, you're not.

12
02:16:32,119 --> 02:16:33,871
Bilbo! KILI: What?

13
02:16:34,121 --> 02:16:35,206
[DWARVES CHATTER]

14
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:38,376
Shh! There are guards nearby!

15
02:16:44,444 --> 02:16:47,468
THORIN: Close the doors, it'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

16
02:16:58,270 --> 02:16:59,933
THORIN: Up the stairs.
DWALIN: You first.

17
02:17:00,022 --> 02:17:00,784
Ori.

18
02:17:00,856 --> 02:17:02,699
BILBO:
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

19
02:17:03,693 --> 02:17:04,527
Go.

20
02:17:04,777 --> 02:17:06,278
OIN:
Easy, now.

21
02:17:13,411 --> 02:17:15,579
[SNORING]

22
02:17:21,377 --> 02:17:22,461
[WHISPERING]
This way.
