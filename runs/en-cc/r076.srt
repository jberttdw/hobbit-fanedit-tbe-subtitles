1
02:55:00,099 --> 02:55:01,850
I will not part with...

2
02:55:02,101 --> 02:55:03,102
...a single coin.

3
02:55:03,769 --> 02:55:06,313
Not one piece of it.

4
02:55:10,192 --> 02:55:11,068
My teeth...

5
02:55:11,318 --> 02:55:12,486
...are swords.

6
02:55:13,404 --> 02:55:16,699
My claws are spears.

7
02:55:18,826 --> 02:55:19,994
My Wings...

8
02:55:20,619 --> 02:55:23,163
...are a hurricane.

9
02:55:28,794 --> 02:55:30,629
So it is true.

10
02:55:31,005 --> 02:55:33,132
The Black Arrow found its mark.

11
02:55:33,382 --> 02:55:34,300
What did you say?

12
02:55:35,134 --> 02:55:39,013
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...

13
02:55:39,263 --> 02:55:40,472
...the Tyrannical.

14
02:55:41,056 --> 02:55:42,141
Truly.

15
02:55:42,391 --> 02:55:44,351
You have no equal on this earth.

16
02:55:48,772 --> 02:55:49,440
I am...

17
02:55:49,690 --> 02:55:52,943
...almost tempted to let you take it.
