02:46:00,469 --> 02:46:01,880
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
He's not at home.

5
02:46:02,829 --> 02:46:04,513
Not at home. Ahem.

6
02:46:05,349 --> 02:46:06,430
Good.

7
02:46:08,229 --> 02:46:09,958
Good, good, good.

8
02:47:04,149 --> 02:47:04,718
What's that?

9
02:47:08,829 --> 02:47:10,797
Shush. Shush.

10
02:47:12,109 --> 02:47:13,395
Arkenstone.

11
02:47:14,429 --> 02:47:15,840
Arkenstone.

12
02:47:16,669 --> 02:47:18,717
A large, white jewel.

13
02:47:20,909 --> 02:47:22,274
Very helpful.

02:49:37,789 --> 02:49:39,553
(SNIFFING)

16
02:49:47,869 --> 02:49:49,280
Well...

17
02:49:50,949 --> 02:49:52,235
...thief.

18
02:49:54,229 --> 02:49:57,870
I smell you.

19
02:49:58,229 --> 02:50:01,438
I hear your breath.

20
02:50:02,749 --> 02:50:04,353
I feel...

21
02:50:04,629 --> 02:50:05,551
...your air.

22
02:50:09,469 --> 02:50:11,995
Where are you?

23
02:50:13,469 --> 02:50:14,550
Where are you?

24
02:50:34,669 --> 02:50:35,670
Come, now...

25
02:50:36,429 --> 02:50:38,557
...don't be shy.

26
02:50:38,829 --> 02:50:41,036
Step into the light.

27
02:50:45,229 --> 02:50:45,832
Hmm.

28
02:50:47,949 --> 02:50:51,158
There is something about you.

29
02:50:54,549 --> 02:50:55,357
Something you...

30
02:50:55,589 --> 02:50:56,431
...carry.

31
02:50:57,589 --> 02:51:00,479
Something made of gold.

32
02:51:01,229 --> 02:51:04,153
But far more...

33
02:51:04,389 --> 02:51:06,198
...precious.

34
02:51:06,429 --> 02:51:08,750
VOICE OF THE RING: <i>Precious! Precious!</i>

35
02:51:11,549 --> 02:51:12,710
There you are...

36
02:51:12,989 --> 02:51:14,514
...Thief in the...

37
02:51:14,749 --> 02:51:16,592
...Shadows.

38
02:51:18,429 --> 02:51:21,035
I did not come to steal from you...

39
02:51:21,269 --> 02:51:22,077
...O Smaug...

40
02:51:22,309 --> 02:51:25,552
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

41
02:51:25,829 --> 02:51:27,433
...to gaze upon your magnificence.

42
02:51:27,789 --> 02:51:28,631
To see...

43
02:51:28,869 --> 02:51:31,839
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

44
02:51:32,549 --> 02:51:34,278
I did not believe them.

45
02:51:43,109 --> 02:51:47,034
And do you now?!

46
02:51:48,389 --> 02:51:49,629
Truly...

47
02:51:50,949 --> 02:51:53,156
...the tales and songs...

48
02:51:54,269 --> 02:51:57,000
...fall utterly short of your enormity...

49
02:51:57,229 --> 02:52:00,199
...O Smaug the Stupendous.

50
02:52:00,429 --> 02:52:03,319
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

51
02:52:03,829 --> 02:52:04,796
No, no.

52
02:52:05,029 --> 02:52:06,519
No, indeed.

53
02:52:08,789 --> 02:52:12,032
You seem familiar with my name...

54
02:52:12,269 --> 02:52:15,159
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.

55
02:52:16,269 --> 02:52:17,873
Who are you...

56
02:52:18,109 --> 02:52:20,635
...and where do you come from...

57
02:52:20,869 --> 02:52:23,190
...may I ask?

58
02:52:32,749 --> 02:52:34,433
I come from under the hill.

59
02:52:34,789 --> 02:52:36,200
Underhill?

60
02:52:39,909 --> 02:52:40,909
BILBO: And under hills...

61
02:52:41,029 --> 02:52:43,031
...and over hills my path has led.

62
02:52:43,909 --> 02:52:44,751
And... And...

63
02:52:45,509 --> 02:52:47,876
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

64
02:52:48,109 --> 02:52:49,838
Impressive.

65
02:52:50,069 --> 02:52:52,117
What else do you claim to be?

66
02:52:53,069 --> 02:52:53,877
I am...

67
02:52:57,109 --> 02:52:58,599
Luck-wearer.

68
02:53:00,029 --> 02:53:01,190
Riddle-maker.

69
02:53:01,469 --> 02:53:03,119
Lovely titles.

70
02:53:03,829 --> 02:53:04,990
Go on.

71
02:53:05,269 --> 02:53:06,350
Barrel-rider.

72
02:53:06,589 --> 02:53:09,991
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

73
02:53:11,469 --> 02:53:12,197
And what about...

74
02:53:12,429 --> 02:53:15,399
...your little Dwarf friends?

75
02:53:16,509 --> 02:53:17,749
Where are they hiding?

76
02:53:20,629 --> 02:53:22,199
Dwarves?

77
02:53:23,029 --> 02:53:24,110
No.

78
02:53:24,789 --> 02:53:26,314
No, no. No Dwarves here.

79
02:53:26,549 --> 02:53:27,630
You've got that all wrong.

80
02:53:27,909 --> 02:53:31,675
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

81
02:53:32,229 --> 02:53:33,469
They sent you in here...

82
02:53:33,749 --> 02:53:35,717
...to do their dirty work while they...

83
02:53:35,949 --> 02:53:37,917
...skulk about outside.

84
02:53:39,149 --> 02:53:40,310
Truly...

85
02:53:41,109 --> 02:53:42,270
...you are mistaken...

86
02:53:42,549 --> 02:53:45,553
...O Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.

87
02:53:45,789 --> 02:53:49,191
You have nice manners...

88
02:53:49,429 --> 02:53:51,397
...for a thief and...

89
02:53:51,629 --> 02:53:52,551
...a liar!

90
02:53:53,909 --> 02:53:57,311
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

91
02:53:57,749 --> 02:53:58,955
No one better!

92
02:54:00,669 --> 02:54:02,080
It is the gold!

93
02:54:02,309 --> 02:54:03,071
They are drawn...

94
02:54:03,309 --> 02:54:04,356
...to treasure like...

95
02:54:04,589 --> 02:54:06,159
...flies to dead flesh.

96
02:54:09,709 --> 02:54:10,949
Did you think I did not know...

97
02:54:11,389 --> 02:54:12,879
...this day would come?!

98
02:54:14,749 --> 02:54:16,035
That a pack of...

99
02:54:16,269 --> 02:54:17,600
...canting Dwarves...

100
02:54:17,829 --> 02:54:20,150
...would come crawling back...

101
02:54:20,709 --> 02:54:21,949
...to the mountain?!
