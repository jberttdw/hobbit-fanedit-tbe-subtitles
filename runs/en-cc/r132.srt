1
04:02:31,142 --> 04:02:32,686
Recall your company.

2
04:02:33,979 --> 04:02:35,855
[HORN BLOWING]

3
04:02:38,817 --> 04:02:41,797
My lord, dispatch this force to Ravenhill.

4
04:02:42,086 --> 04:02:44,823
The Dwarves are about to be
overrun. Thorin must be warned.

5
04:02:45,073 --> 04:02:46,876
By all means, warn him.

6
04:02:47,312 --> 04:02:51,580
I have spent enough Elvish blood in
defense of this accursed land. No more.

7
04:02:51,830 --> 04:02:53,290
Thranduil?

8
04:02:54,291 --> 04:02:55,054
I'll go.

9
04:02:56,167 --> 04:02:57,252
Don't be ridiculous.

10
04:02:57,502 --> 04:02:59,838
- You'll never make it.
- Why not?

11
04:03:00,714 --> 04:03:03,258
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.

12
04:03:04,134 --> 04:03:05,468
No, they won't.

13
04:03:07,012 --> 04:03:08,012
They won't see me.

14
04:03:09,347 --> 04:03:11,016
It's out of the question.

15
04:03:12,017 --> 04:03:13,018
I won't allow it.

16
04:03:14,019 --> 04:03:16,438
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.
