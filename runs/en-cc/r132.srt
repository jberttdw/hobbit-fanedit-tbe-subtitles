1
04:02:31,492 --> 04:02:33,036
Recall your company.

2
04:02:34,329 --> 04:02:36,205
[HORN BLOWING]

3
04:02:39,167 --> 04:02:41,002
My lord, dispatch this force...

4
04:02:41,252 --> 04:02:43,046
...to Ravenhill.
The Dwarves are about...

5
04:02:43,296 --> 04:02:44,088
...to be overrun.

6
04:02:44,339 --> 04:02:45,173
Thorin must be warned.

7
04:02:45,423 --> 04:02:47,675
By all means, warn him.

8
04:02:47,926 --> 04:02:50,261
I have spent enough Elvish blood
in defense...

9
04:02:50,511 --> 04:02:51,930
...of this accursed land. No more.

10
04:02:52,180 --> 04:02:53,640
Thranduil?

11
04:02:54,641 --> 04:02:55,350
I'll go.

12
04:02:56,517 --> 04:02:57,602
Don't be ridiculous.

13
04:02:57,852 --> 04:02:59,270
You'll never make it.

14
04:02:59,520 --> 04:03:00,188
Why not?

15
04:03:01,064 --> 04:03:03,608
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.

16
04:03:04,484 --> 04:03:05,818
No, they won't.

17
04:03:07,362 --> 04:03:08,321
They won't see me.

18
04:03:09,697 --> 04:03:11,366
It's out of the question.

19
04:03:12,367 --> 04:03:13,368
I won't allow it.

20
04:03:14,369 --> 04:03:16,788
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.
