It's Thorin.

04:00:44,131 --> 04:00:45,173
And Fili, Kili...

04:00:45,799 --> 04:00:47,175
...and Dwalin.

4
04:00:48,218 --> 04:00:50,220
He's taking his best warriors.

5
04:00:50,470 --> 04:00:51,680
To do what?

6
04:00:52,556 --> 04:00:54,933
To cut the head off the snake.

7
04:01:16,079 --> 04:01:16,788
[YELLS]

8
04:01:28,717 --> 04:01:29,467
Die!

Gandalf!

10
04:01:38,810 --> 04:01:40,020
Legolas.

12
04:01:43,064 --> 04:01:44,274
There is a second army.

Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.

14
04:01:47,736 --> 04:01:49,196
Gundabad.

15
04:01:50,405 --> 04:01:52,073
This was their plan all along.

16
04:01:54,784 --> 04:01:58,246
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.

17
04:01:58,496 --> 04:01:59,873
The North?

18
04:02:00,123 --> 04:02:01,458
Where is the North...

19
04:02:01,708 --> 04:02:03,793
- ...exactly?
- Ravenhill.

20
04:02:05,003 --> 04:02:06,046
Ravenhill?

21
04:02:06,296 --> 04:02:07,964
Thorin is up there.

22
04:02:08,215 --> 04:02:10,217
And Fili and Kili. They're all up there.
