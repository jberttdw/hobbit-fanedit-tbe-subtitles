The Elven Gate.

01:56:08,812 --> 01:56:11,940
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

01:56:12,274 --> 01:56:15,319
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.

01:56:22,576 --> 01:56:24,703
Set the ponies loose.

5
01:56:25,162 --> 01:56:27,789
Let them return to their master.

BILBO:
This forest feels...

8
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:34,004
...sick.

9
01:56:34,505 --> 01:56:36,673
As if a disease lies upon it.

10
01:56:39,218 --> 01:56:40,802
Is there no way around?

11
01:56:41,053 --> 01:56:43,514
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

12
01:56:43,764 --> 01:56:45,849
Or twice that distance...

13
01:56:46,808 --> 01:56:48,101
...south.
