1
02:34:56,481 --> 02:34:58,108
BILBO:
What is this place?

2
02:34:58,358 --> 02:34:59,651
BALIN:
It was once the city of Dale.

3
02:35:01,653 --> 02:35:03,321
Now it is a ruin.

4
02:35:04,072 --> 02:35:06,283
The desolation of Smaug.

5
02:35:06,533 --> 02:35:08,452
The sun will soon reach midday.

6
02:35:08,702 --> 02:35:10,954
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

7
02:35:11,204 --> 02:35:12,039
This way.

8
02:35:12,289 --> 02:35:14,332
Wait. Is this the overlook?

9
02:35:14,666 --> 02:35:16,001
Gandalf said to meet him here.

10
02:35:16,251 --> 02:35:17,878
- On no account were we to--
- Do you see him?

11
02:35:18,545 --> 02:35:20,839
We have no time to wait upon the Wizard.

12
02:35:21,131 --> 02:35:22,883
We're on our own. Come!
