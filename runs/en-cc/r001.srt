My dear Frodo:

2
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,868
You asked me once...

3
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:19,748
...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.

4
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:23,668
And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...

5
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,172
...I may not have told you all of it.

6
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:37,265
I am old now, Frodo.

7
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:41,519
I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.

8
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:49,319
I think it is time for you to know...

9
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,155
...what really happened.
