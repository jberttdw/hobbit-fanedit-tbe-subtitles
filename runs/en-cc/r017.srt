1
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,966
Not with your companions?

2
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:56,967
Uh, no, I shan't be missed.

3
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:03,352
The truth is that most of them
don't think I should be on this journey.

4
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,063
Indeed?

5
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:09,358
I've heard that Hobbits are very resilient.

6
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,280
Really?

7
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:19,281
ELROND: Mm.

8
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:24,870
I've also heard they're fond
of the comforts of home.

9
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:30,713
I've heard that it's unwise
to seek the council of Elves.

10
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:35,714
That they will answer with yes and no.

11
01:07:39,407 --> 01:07:40,407
[LAUGHS]

12
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:47,434
You are very welcome to stay here,
if that is your wish.
