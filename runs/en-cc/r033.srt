Where's Bilbo?

Where is our Hobbit?!?

Curse that Halfling! Now he's lost?

I thought he was with Dori!

-Don't blame me!
-Well, where did you last see him?

23
01:39:05,284 --> 01:39:07,994
I think I saw him slip away
when they first collared us.

And what happened, exactly?

-Tell me!
-I'll tell you what happened.

Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.

27
01:39:15,961 --> 01:39:18,963
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

28
01:39:19,131 --> 01:39:21,507
...since first he stepped out of his door.

29

We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

No. He isn't.

I have never been so glad
to see anyone in my life.

did you get past the Goblins?

It matters. I want to know.

Why did you come back?

41
01:40:21,401 --> 01:40:24,487
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

42
01:40:26,031 --> 01:40:28,991
And you're right, I often think of Bag End.

43
01:40:29,576 --> 01:40:31,619
I miss my books.

44
01:40:32,371 --> 01:40:35,122
And my armchair and my garden.

See, that's where I belong.

That's home.

47
01:40:41,672 --> 01:40:43,756
And that's why I came back. Because...

48
01:40:46,093 --> 01:40:48,970
...you don't have one. A home.

49
01:40:49,638 --> 01:40:51,222
It was taken from you.
