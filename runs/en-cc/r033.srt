Curse that Halfling! Now he's lost?

I thought he was with Dori!

-Don't blame me!
-Well, where did you last see him?

01:39:05,284 --> 01:39:07,994
I think I saw him slip away

And what happened, exactly?

Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.

01:39:15,961 --> 01:39:18,963
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

28

...since first he stepped out of his door.

We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

Why did you come back?

41

Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

42
01:40:26,031 --> 01:40:28,991
And you're right, I often think of Bag End.

I miss my books.

That's home.

And that's why I came back. Because...

...you don't have one. A home.
