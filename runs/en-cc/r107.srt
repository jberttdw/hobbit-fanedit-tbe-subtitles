1
03:29:08,741 --> 03:29:12,161
GANDALF: Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?

2
03:29:12,411 --> 03:29:14,079
What do you think I'm trying to do?

3
03:29:14,330 --> 03:29:16,874
Save your Dwarvish friends,
and I admire...

4
03:29:17,124 --> 03:29:19,335
...your loyalty to them.

5
03:29:19,585 --> 03:29:22,338
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.

6
03:29:23,130 --> 03:29:25,507
You started this, Mithrandir.

7
03:29:26,091 --> 03:29:29,053
You will forgive me if I finish it.

8
03:29:29,303 --> 03:29:31,013
Are the archers in position?

9
03:29:31,889 --> 03:29:34,099
FEREN: Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.

10
03:29:34,725 --> 03:29:36,977
If anything moves on that Mountain...

11
03:29:37,228 --> 03:29:38,312
...kill it.

12
03:29:41,315 --> 03:29:43,609
The Dwarves are out of time.

13
03:30:10,511 --> 03:30:11,303
You, Bowman!

14
03:30:12,763 --> 03:30:13,764
Do you agree?

15
03:30:14,014 --> 03:30:16,308
Is gold so important to you?

16
03:30:17,101 --> 03:30:19,603
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?

17
03:30:20,312 --> 03:30:21,355
It won't come to that.

18
03:30:21,605 --> 03:30:24,358
- This is a fight they cannot win.
BILBO: That won't stop them.

19
03:30:24,608 --> 03:30:27,528
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.

20
03:30:27,778 --> 03:30:29,571
They will fight to the death.

21
03:30:29,822 --> 03:30:31,282
Bilbo Baggins.

22
03:30:31,824 --> 03:30:33,075
THRANDUIL:
If I'm not mistaken...

23
03:30:33,325 --> 03:30:35,744
...this is the Halfling who stole the keys...

24
03:30:35,995 --> 03:30:37,621
...to my dungeons from under...

25
03:30:37,871 --> 03:30:39,707
...the nose of my guards.

26
03:30:42,209 --> 03:30:43,294
Yes.

27
03:30:44,295 --> 03:30:45,045
Sorry...

28
03:30:45,296 --> 03:30:46,463
...about that.

29
03:30:47,006 --> 03:30:47,840
I came...

30
03:30:49,758 --> 03:30:50,759
...to give you...

31
03:30:51,010 --> 03:30:52,011
...this.

32
03:30:56,765 --> 03:30:58,642
The Heart of the Mountain.

33
03:31:00,561 --> 03:31:01,895
The King's Jewel.

34
03:31:03,355 --> 03:31:05,357
And worth a king's ransom.

35
03:31:07,276 --> 03:31:08,027
How is this...

36
03:31:08,277 --> 03:31:09,403
...yours to give?

37
03:31:09,653 --> 03:31:11,655
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.

38
03:31:13,282 --> 03:31:14,408
BARD:
Why would you do this?

39
03:31:14,658 --> 03:31:15,909
You owe us no loyalty.

40
03:31:16,160 --> 03:31:17,870
I'm not doing it for you.

41
03:31:19,705 --> 03:31:21,957
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate...

42
03:31:22,458 --> 03:31:23,751
...and pigheaded...

43
03:31:24,460 --> 03:31:25,586
...and difficult.

44
03:31:25,836 --> 03:31:27,629
They're suspicious and secretive...

45
03:31:27,880 --> 03:31:29,423
...with the worst manners...

46
03:31:29,673 --> 03:31:31,717
...imaginable,
but they are also brave...

47
03:31:31,967 --> 03:31:33,218
...and kind...

48
03:31:34,803 --> 03:31:36,138
...and loyal to a fault.

49
03:31:37,306 --> 03:31:38,140
I've grown...

50
03:31:38,390 --> 03:31:41,101
...very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.

51
03:31:41,935 --> 03:31:42,978
Now, Thorin...

52
03:31:43,228 --> 03:31:45,481
...values this stone above all else.

53
03:31:45,731 --> 03:31:48,108
In exchange for its return,
he will give you...

54
03:31:48,359 --> 03:31:49,443
...what you are owed.

55
03:31:49,693 --> 03:31:50,652
There will be no need...

56
03:31:50,903 --> 03:31:51,820
...for war.

57
03:31:57,326 --> 03:31:58,327
GANDALF:
<i>Rest up tonight.</i>

58
03:31:58,577 --> 03:32:01,246
- You must leave on the morrow.
- What?

59
03:32:01,497 --> 03:32:04,416
- Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.

60
03:32:04,666 --> 03:32:07,419
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not leaving the Company.

61
03:32:07,669 --> 03:32:09,671
There is no Company. Not anymore.

62
03:32:09,922 --> 03:32:12,383
Imagine what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.

63
03:32:12,633 --> 03:32:14,218
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

64
03:32:14,468 --> 03:32:15,761
Well, you should be.

65
03:32:16,345 --> 03:32:17,346
Don't underestimate...

66
03:32:17,596 --> 03:32:19,515
...the evil of gold.

67
03:32:19,765 --> 03:32:20,766
Gold over which...

68
03:32:21,016 --> 03:32:23,102
...a serpent has long brooded.

69
03:32:23,352 --> 03:32:25,896
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all...

70
03:32:26,146 --> 03:32:27,815
...who come near this Mountain.

71
03:32:29,441 --> 03:32:30,442
Almost all. Heh.
