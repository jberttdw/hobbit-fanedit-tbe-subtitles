1
03:29:09,201 --> 03:29:12,621
GANDALF: Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?

2
03:29:12,871 --> 03:29:14,539
What do you think I'm trying to do?

3
03:29:14,790 --> 03:29:17,334
Save your Dwarvish friends,
and I admire...

4
03:29:17,584 --> 03:29:19,795
...your loyalty to them.

5
03:29:20,045 --> 03:29:22,798
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.

6
03:29:23,590 --> 03:29:25,967
You started this, Mithrandir.

7
03:29:26,551 --> 03:29:29,513
You will forgive me if I finish it.

8
03:29:29,763 --> 03:29:31,473
Are the archers in position?

9
03:29:32,349 --> 03:29:34,559
FEREN: Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.

10
03:29:35,185 --> 03:29:37,437
If anything moves on that Mountain...

11
03:29:37,688 --> 03:29:38,772
...kill it.

12
03:29:41,775 --> 03:29:44,069
The Dwarves are out of time.

13
03:30:10,971 --> 03:30:11,763
You, Bowman!

14
03:30:13,223 --> 03:30:14,224
Do you agree?

15
03:30:14,474 --> 03:30:16,768
Is gold so important to you?

16
03:30:17,561 --> 03:30:20,063
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?

17
03:30:20,772 --> 03:30:21,815
It won't come to that.

18
03:30:22,065 --> 03:30:24,818
- This is a fight they cannot win.
BILBO: That won't stop them.

19
03:30:25,068 --> 03:30:27,988
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.

20
03:30:28,238 --> 03:30:30,031
They will fight to the death.

21
03:30:30,282 --> 03:30:31,742
Bilbo Baggins.

22
03:30:32,284 --> 03:30:33,535
THRANDUIL:
If I'm not mistaken...

23
03:30:33,785 --> 03:30:36,204
...this is the Halfling who stole the keys...

24
03:30:36,455 --> 03:30:38,081
...to my dungeons from under...

25
03:30:38,331 --> 03:30:40,167
...the nose of my guards.

26
03:30:42,669 --> 03:30:43,754
Yes.

27
03:30:44,755 --> 03:30:45,505
Sorry...

28
03:30:45,756 --> 03:30:46,923
...about that.

29
03:30:47,466 --> 03:30:48,300
I came...

30
03:30:50,218 --> 03:30:51,219
...to give you...

31
03:30:51,470 --> 03:30:52,471
...this.

32
03:30:57,225 --> 03:30:59,102
The Heart of the Mountain.

33
03:31:01,021 --> 03:31:02,355
The King's Jewel.

34
03:31:03,815 --> 03:31:05,817
And worth a king's ransom.

35
03:31:07,736 --> 03:31:08,487
How is this...

36
03:31:08,737 --> 03:31:09,863
...yours to give?

37
03:31:10,113 --> 03:31:12,115
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.

38
03:31:13,742 --> 03:31:14,868
BARD:
Why would you do this?

39
03:31:15,118 --> 03:31:16,369
You owe us no loyalty.

40
03:31:16,620 --> 03:31:18,330
I'm not doing it for you.

41
03:31:20,165 --> 03:31:22,417
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate...

42
03:31:22,918 --> 03:31:24,211
...and pigheaded...

43
03:31:24,920 --> 03:31:26,046
...and difficult.

44
03:31:26,296 --> 03:31:28,089
They're suspicious and secretive...

45
03:31:28,340 --> 03:31:29,883
...with the worst manners...

46
03:31:30,133 --> 03:31:32,177
...imaginable,
but they are also brave...

47
03:31:32,427 --> 03:31:33,678
...and kind...

48
03:31:35,263 --> 03:31:36,598
...and loyal to a fault.

49
03:31:37,766 --> 03:31:38,600
I've grown...

50
03:31:38,850 --> 03:31:41,561
...very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.

51
03:31:42,395 --> 03:31:43,438
Now, Thorin...

52
03:31:43,688 --> 03:31:45,941
...values this stone above all else.

53
03:31:46,191 --> 03:31:48,568
In exchange for its return,
he will give you...

54
03:31:48,819 --> 03:31:49,903
...what you are owed.

55
03:31:50,153 --> 03:31:51,112
There will be no need...

56
03:31:51,363 --> 03:31:52,280
...for war.

57
03:31:57,786 --> 03:31:58,787
GANDALF:
<i>Rest up tonight.</i>

58
03:31:59,037 --> 03:32:01,706
- You must leave on the morrow.
- What?

59
03:32:01,957 --> 03:32:04,876
- Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.

60
03:32:05,126 --> 03:32:07,879
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not leaving the Company.

61
03:32:08,129 --> 03:32:10,131
There is no Company. Not anymore.

62
03:32:10,382 --> 03:32:12,843
Imagine what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.

63
03:32:13,093 --> 03:32:14,678
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

64
03:32:14,928 --> 03:32:16,221
Well, you should be.

65
03:32:16,805 --> 03:32:17,806
Don't underestimate...

66
03:32:18,056 --> 03:32:19,975
...the evil of gold.

67
03:32:20,225 --> 03:32:21,226
Gold over which...

68
03:32:21,476 --> 03:32:23,562
...a serpent has long brooded.

69
03:32:23,812 --> 03:32:26,356
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all...

70
03:32:26,606 --> 03:32:28,275
...who come near this Mountain.

71
03:32:29,901 --> 03:32:30,902
Almost all. Heh.
