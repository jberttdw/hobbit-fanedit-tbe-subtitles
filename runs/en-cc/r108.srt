We have come to tell you...

03:33:53,207 --> 03:33:56,460
...payment of your debt has been offered...

5
03:33:56,710 --> 03:33:58,170
...and accepted.

03:33:59,630 --> 03:34:00,631
THORIN:
What payment?

7
03:34:01,799 --> 03:34:03,091
I gave you nothing.

8
03:34:03,842 --> 03:34:05,594
You have nothing.

9
03:34:12,518 --> 03:34:13,977
We have this.

They have the Arkenstone.

11
03:34:20,901 --> 03:34:22,027
Thieves!

12
03:34:22,653 --> 03:34:25,781
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?

13
03:34:26,031 --> 03:34:27,533
That stone belongs to the king!

14
03:34:29,117 --> 03:34:30,369
And the king may have it...

15
03:34:31,245 --> 03:34:32,746
...with our goodwill.

16

But first he must honor his word.

17

They are taking us for fools.

18
03:34:47,511 --> 03:34:48,887
This is a ruse.

19
03:34:50,472 --> 03:34:52,224
A filthy lie.

20
03:34:53,559 --> 03:34:56,478
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!

21
03:34:56,728 --> 03:34:57,855
It is a trick!

BILBO:
It's no trick.

23
03:35:00,899 --> 03:35:02,192
The stone is real.

24
03:35:03,735 --> 03:35:05,320
I gave it to them.

25

You?

26
03:35:16,915 --> 03:35:19,126
I took it as my 14th share.

27
03:35:21,003 --> 03:35:22,838
You would steal from me?

28
03:35:23,088 --> 03:35:24,256
Steal from you? No.

29
03:35:24,506 --> 03:35:27,718
No, I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.

30
03:35:30,929 --> 03:35:32,848
I'll let it stand against my claim.

31

The Dwarf I met...

39
03:35:56,330 --> 03:35:59,207
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word.

40
03:35:59,458 --> 03:36:00,709
Would never have doubted...

41
03:36:00,959 --> 03:36:02,502
...the loyalty of his kin!

42

I will do it myself. Curse you!
