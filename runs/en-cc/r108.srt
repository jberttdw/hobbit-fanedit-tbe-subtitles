We have come to tell you...

03:33:52,857 --> 03:33:56,110
...payment of your debt has been offered...

5
03:33:56,360 --> 03:33:57,820
...and accepted.

03:33:59,280 --> 03:34:00,281
THORIN:
What payment?

7
03:34:01,449 --> 03:34:02,741
I gave you nothing.

8
03:34:03,492 --> 03:34:05,244
You have nothing.

9
03:34:12,168 --> 03:34:13,627
We have this.

10

KILI:
They have the Arkenstone.

11
03:34:20,551 --> 03:34:21,677
Thieves!

12
03:34:22,303 --> 03:34:25,431
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?

13
03:34:25,681 --> 03:34:27,183
That stone belongs to the king!

14
03:34:28,767 --> 03:34:30,019
And the king may have it...

15
03:34:30,895 --> 03:34:32,396
...with our goodwill.

16
03:34:37,318 --> 03:34:41,280
But first he must honor his word.

17
03:34:43,741 --> 03:34:45,451
They are taking us for fools.

18
03:34:47,161 --> 03:34:48,537
This is a ruse.

19
03:34:50,122 --> 03:34:51,874
A filthy lie.

20
03:34:53,209 --> 03:34:56,128
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!

21
03:34:56,378 --> 03:34:57,505
It is a trick!

BILBO:
It's no trick.

23
03:35:00,549 --> 03:35:01,842
The stone is real.

24
03:35:03,385 --> 03:35:04,970
I gave it to them.

25
03:35:13,187 --> 03:35:14,021
You?

26
03:35:16,565 --> 03:35:18,776
I took it as my 14th share.

27
03:35:20,653 --> 03:35:22,488
You would steal from me?

28
03:35:22,738 --> 03:35:23,906
Steal from you? No.

29
03:35:24,156 --> 03:35:27,368
No, I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.

30
03:35:30,579 --> 03:35:32,498
I'll let it stand against my claim.

31

Against your claim?

You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!

The Dwarf I met...

39
03:35:55,980 --> 03:35:58,857
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word.

40
03:35:59,108 --> 03:36:00,359
Would never have doubted...

41
03:36:00,609 --> 03:36:02,152
...the loyalty of his kin!

42
03:36:02,903 --> 03:36:05,155

I will do it myself. Curse you!

No!
