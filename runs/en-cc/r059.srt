02:12:23,950 --> 02:12:25,555
GLOIN: Again!
BALIN: Leave it!

2
02:12:25,785 --> 02:12:27,203
There's no way out!

3
02:12:27,453 --> 02:12:29,455
This is no Orc dungeon.

4
02:12:29,706 --> 02:12:32,208
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

5
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:36,296
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

6
02:12:40,967 --> 02:12:44,512
THRANDUIL: Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

7
02:12:45,179 --> 02:12:48,016
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

8
02:12:48,266 --> 02:12:50,018
...and slay a dragon.

9
02:12:51,394 --> 02:12:55,398
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

10
02:12:56,274 --> 02:12:57,942
Attempted burglary.

11
02:12:58,693 --> 02:13:00,945
Or something of that ilk.

12
02:13:04,115 --> 02:13:04,866
You have found...

13
02:13:05,116 --> 02:13:06,117
...a way in.

14
02:13:06,367 --> 02:13:07,326
You seek that which would...

15
02:13:07,577 --> 02:13:10,580
...bestow upon you the right to rule.

16
02:13:11,247 --> 02:13:13,124
The King's Jewel.

17
02:13:14,042 --> 02:13:15,543
The Arkenstone.

18
02:13:17,795 --> 02:13:21,132
It is precious to you beyond measure.

19
02:13:22,133 --> 02:13:23,843
I understand that.

20
02:13:24,802 --> 02:13:28,431
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

21
02:13:29,766 --> 02:13:30,767
White gems...

22
02:13:31,017 --> 02:13:33,061
...of pure starlight.

23
02:13:34,103 --> 02:13:36,355
I offer you my help.

24
02:13:39,567 --> 02:13:40,943
I am listening.

25
02:13:41,194 --> 02:13:42,820
I will let you go...

26
02:13:43,821 --> 02:13:46,491
...if you but return what is mine.

27
02:13:49,702 --> 02:13:50,995
THORIN:
A favor for a favor.

28
02:13:51,245 --> 02:13:52,205
THRANDUIL:
You have my word.

29
02:13:53,623 --> 02:13:56,125
One king to another.

30
02:14:00,296 --> 02:14:03,508
I would not trust Thranduil...

31
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:05,510
...the great king...

32
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:06,928
...to honor his word...

33
02:14:07,178 --> 02:14:09,680
...should the end of all days
be upon us!

34
02:14:10,306 --> 02:14:10,890
You...

35
02:14:11,391 --> 02:14:12,350
...who lack all...

36
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:13,601
... honor.

37
02:14:14,685 --> 02:14:16,729
I have seen how you treat your friends.

38
02:14:17,396 --> 02:14:21,025
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

39
02:14:21,275 --> 02:14:22,735
...seeking your help.

40
02:14:23,277 --> 02:14:25,655
But you turned your back!

41
02:14:25,947 --> 02:14:29,575
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

42
02:14:29,826 --> 02:14:31,786
...and the inferno that destroyed us.

43
02:14:32,033 --> 02:14:34,251
[SPEAKS IN DWARVISH]

44
02:14:34,330 --> 02:14:36,499
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

45
02:14:36,958 --> 02:14:37,542
I know...

46
02:14:37,792 --> 02:14:40,044
...its wrath and ruin.

47
02:14:41,838 --> 02:14:43,256
[INHALES]

48
02:14:44,215 --> 02:14:45,424
I have faced...

49
02:14:45,675 --> 02:14:48,428
...the great serpents of the North.

50
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:51,264
I warned your...

51
02:14:51,514 --> 02:14:54,809
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.

52
02:14:56,352 --> 02:14:58,271
But he would not listen.

53
02:15:02,859 --> 02:15:04,902
You are just like him.

54
02:15:07,363 --> 02:15:09,115
Stay here if you will...

55
02:15:09,365 --> 02:15:10,908
...and rot.

56
02:15:11,159 --> 02:15:13,077
A hundred years is a mere blink...

57
02:15:13,327 --> 02:15:15,329
...in the life of an Elf.

58
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:17,248
I'm patient.

59
02:15:18,291 --> 02:15:20,293
I can wait.

60
02:15:27,758 --> 02:15:28,843
Did he offer you a deal?

61
02:15:29,093 --> 02:15:30,261
He did.

62
02:15:31,971 --> 02:15:35,589
<i>I told him</i> he <i>could go
ish kakhfé ai-'d dEIr-rugnu!</i>

63
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:36,893
Him and all his kin!

64
02:15:38,936 --> 02:15:40,688
Well, that's that, then.

65
02:15:42,398 --> 02:15:44,901
A deal was our only hope.
