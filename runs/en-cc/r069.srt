Da! Where have you been?

02:26:38,336 --> 02:26:41,297
Father! There you are! I was worried.

02:26:41,672 --> 02:26:43,049
Here, Sigrid.

4
02:26:43,633 --> 02:26:44,592
<i>Bain, get them in.</i>

5
02:26:52,350 --> 02:26:54,936
If you speak of this to anyone...

6
02:26:55,186 --> 02:26:56,646
...I'll rip your arms off.

7
02:26:59,524 --> 02:27:00,983
Get off.

8
02:27:02,443 --> 02:27:03,528

SIGRID:
Da...

10
02:27:12,328 --> 02:27:14,580
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

11
02:27:14,831 --> 02:27:16,165
Will they bring us luck?

12
02:27:20,753 --> 02:27:21,587
They may not be the best fit...

13
02:27:21,838 --> 02:27:23,589
...but they'll keep you warm.

14
02:27:24,257 --> 02:27:25,299
Thank you very much.

You look like...

17
02:27:38,729 --> 02:27:40,022
...you've seen a ghost.

18
02:27:40,773 --> 02:27:41,941
He has.

19
02:27:42,733 --> 02:27:43,734
The last time we saw...

20
02:27:43,985 --> 02:27:45,653
...such a weapon...

21
02:27:46,696 --> 02:27:47,572
...a city was on fire.

22
02:27:49,615 --> 02:27:51,868
It was the day the dragon came.

<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

...rallied his bowmen...

28

<i>...to fire upon the beast.</i>

29
02:28:06,132 --> 02:28:07,884
But a dragon's hide is tough.

30
02:28:08,467 --> 02:28:10,636
Tougher than the strongest armor.

31
02:28:10,887 --> 02:28:14,056
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

32
02:28:14,307 --> 02:28:15,892
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

33
02:28:16,851 --> 02:28:17,894

You speak as if you were there.

All Dwarves know the tale.

42

Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

43
02:28:54,847 --> 02:28:56,724
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

44
02:28:56,974 --> 02:28:58,226
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.
