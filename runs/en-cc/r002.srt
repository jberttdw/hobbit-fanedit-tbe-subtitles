1
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,538
It began....

2
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,957
Well, it began as you might expect.

3
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,794
In a hole in the ground...

4
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:04,505
...there lived a Hobbit.

5
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:11,887
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.

6
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:14,223
This was a Hobbit hole.

7
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:19,687
And that means good food, a warm hearth...

8
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:22,857
...and all the comforts of home.
