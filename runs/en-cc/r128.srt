1
03:59:00,298 --> 03:59:01,673
Hold tight, lads.

2
03:59:17,273 --> 03:59:18,273
KILI:
There's more coming!

3
03:59:20,777 --> 03:59:22,486
[SNARLING]

4
03:59:22,737 --> 03:59:24,279
We're pulling too much weight.

5
03:59:24,531 --> 03:59:25,864
We won't make it.

6
03:59:26,115 --> 03:59:27,115
Cut the tracers.

7
03:59:28,952 --> 03:59:30,536
Ride them to Ravenhill.

8
03:59:31,538 --> 03:59:32,538
No, Balin.

9
03:59:34,165 --> 03:59:36,542
My goat-riding days are over.

10
03:59:38,670 --> 03:59:40,254
Durin be with you, brother.
