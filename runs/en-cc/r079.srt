1
02:57:39,504 --> 02:57:40,505
You think you...

2
02:57:40,755 --> 02:57:42,715
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

3
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:49,263
You have come from Lake-town.

4
02:57:50,973 --> 02:57:52,266
This is some...

5
02:57:52,517 --> 02:57:55,770
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

6
02:57:56,020 --> 02:57:59,190
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

7
02:58:00,191 --> 02:58:02,109
Those sniveling cowards...

8
02:58:02,360 --> 02:58:03,820
...with their long bows...

9
02:58:04,070 --> 02:58:06,906
...and Black Arrows.

10
02:58:07,281 --> 02:58:09,158
Perhaps it is time...

11
02:58:09,408 --> 02:58:11,285
...I paid them a visit.

12
02:58:11,828 --> 02:58:13,079
Oh, no.

13
02:58:14,956 --> 02:58:16,415
This isn't their fault!

14
02:58:16,666 --> 02:58:17,458
Wait!

15
02:58:17,708 --> 02:58:19,293
You cannot go to Lake-town!

16
02:58:21,212 --> 02:58:23,381
You care about them...

17
02:58:24,090 --> 02:58:25,341
...do you?

18
02:58:25,591 --> 02:58:26,551
Good.

19
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:27,844
Then you can...

20
02:58:28,094 --> 02:58:29,679
...watch them die.
