The Valley of Imladris.

GANDALF: Here lies the Last
Homely House East of the Sea.

00:56:51,428 --> 00:56:54,013
This was your plan all along.

6
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:56,599
To seek refuge with our enemy.

7
00:56:56,808 --> 00:57:00,102
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

8
00:57:00,312 --> 00:57:04,190
The only ill will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself.

00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:08,694
You think the Elves will
give our quest their blessing?

10
00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:11,280
They will try to stop us.

11
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:15,451
Of course they will. But we have
questions that need to be answered.

12
00:57:18,997 --> 00:57:22,583
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.

13
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,126
And respect.

14
00:57:24,294 --> 00:57:26,796
And no small degree of charm.

15
00:57:27,005 --> 00:57:31,008

leave the talking to me.

00:58:37,784 --> 00:58:39,618
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

[IN ENGLISH]
My Lord Elrond is not here.

22
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:43,998
Not here?
