1
01:11:26,186 --> 01:11:28,521
Where's Bilbo? Where's the Hobbit?

2
01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:29,814
[BILBO GRUNTING]

3
01:11:30,023 --> 01:11:31,315
There!

4
01:11:34,278 --> 01:11:35,695
THORIN:
Get him!

5
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:37,572
Aah!

6
01:11:37,781 --> 01:11:40,074
-Grab my hand!
-Bilbo!

7
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:43,870
DORI: Ori, be careful!
ORI: Take it!

8
01:11:44,037 --> 01:11:46,539
DWALIN: I've got you, lad.
ORI: Grab on! Grab on!

9
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:56,549
[GRUNTING]

10
01:11:56,717 --> 01:11:59,552
Come on. Get him.

11
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,387
GLOIN:
Come on, lad. Up you get.

12
01:12:04,641 --> 01:12:06,976
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

13
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:10,021
He's been lost ever since he left home.

14
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:12,732
He should never have come.

15
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,817
He has no place amongst us.

16
01:12:16,737 --> 01:12:18,446
Dwalin!

17
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:26,996
DWALIN: lt looks safe enough.
THORIN: Search to the back.

18
01:12:27,456 --> 01:12:30,249
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

19
01:12:33,754 --> 01:12:35,713
DWALIN:
There's nothing here.

20
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:39,675
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

21
01:12:39,843 --> 01:12:42,762
No. No fires. Not in this place.

22
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,639
Get some sleep.

23
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:47,308
We start at first light.

24
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:51,187
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

25
01:12:51,355 --> 01:12:54,315
-That was the plan.
-Plans change.

26
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:57,985
Bofur, take the first watch.
