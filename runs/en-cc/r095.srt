1
03:07:02,369 --> 03:07:04,204
We must look to our own.

2
03:07:04,788 --> 03:07:07,249
To the sick and the helpless.

3
03:07:07,874 --> 03:07:10,293
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.

4
03:07:10,544 --> 03:07:12,045
Those who have strength, follow me.

5
03:07:12,879 --> 03:07:14,339
We must salvage what we can.

6
03:07:14,589 --> 03:07:16,007
What then? What'll we do then?

7
03:07:20,846 --> 03:07:22,347
We find shelter.
