1
03:26:48,946 --> 03:26:51,866
GANDALF: You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.

2
03:26:52,116 --> 03:26:53,159
War is coming!

3
03:26:53,409 --> 03:26:54,535
The cesspits...

4
03:26:54,785 --> 03:26:56,162
...of Dol Guldur have been...

5
03:26:56,412 --> 03:26:57,205
...emptied.

6
03:26:57,455 --> 03:26:58,164
You're all...

7
03:26:58,414 --> 03:26:59,499
...in mortal danger.

8
03:26:59,749 --> 03:27:01,042
What are you talking about?

9
03:27:02,293 --> 03:27:03,377
You know nothing...

10
03:27:03,628 --> 03:27:04,879
...of Wizards.

11
03:27:05,129 --> 03:27:07,381
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...

12
03:27:07,632 --> 03:27:11,135
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.

13
03:27:12,845 --> 03:27:14,931
But sometimes a storm...

14
03:27:15,181 --> 03:27:16,807
...is just a storm.

15
03:27:17,058 --> 03:27:18,559
Not this time.

16
03:27:18,809 --> 03:27:21,270
Armies of Orcs are on the move.

17
03:27:21,521 --> 03:27:23,856
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.

18
03:27:24,106 --> 03:27:26,734
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

19
03:27:26,984 --> 03:27:28,528
Why show his hand now?

20
03:27:28,778 --> 03:27:30,029
Because we forced him.

21
03:27:30,279 --> 03:27:33,449
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
set out to reclaim...

22
03:27:33,699 --> 03:27:35,076
...their homeland.
