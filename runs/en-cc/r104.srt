1
03:26:48,556 --> 03:26:51,476
GANDALF: You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.

2
03:26:51,726 --> 03:26:52,769
War is coming!

3
03:26:53,019 --> 03:26:56,815
The cesspits of Dol Guldur
have been emptied.

4
03:26:57,065 --> 03:26:59,109
You're all in mortal danger.

5
03:26:59,359 --> 03:27:00,652
What are you talking about?

6
03:27:01,903 --> 03:27:04,489
I can see you know nothing of Wizards.

7
03:27:04,739 --> 03:27:06,991
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...

8
03:27:07,242 --> 03:27:10,745
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.

9
03:27:12,455 --> 03:27:16,417
But sometimes a storm is <i>just a storm.</i>

10
03:27:16,668 --> 03:27:18,169
Not this time.

11
03:27:18,419 --> 03:27:20,880
Armies of Orcs are on the move.

12
03:27:21,131 --> 03:27:23,466
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.

13
03:27:23,716 --> 03:27:26,344
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

14
03:27:26,594 --> 03:27:28,138
Why show his hand now?

15
03:27:28,388 --> 03:27:29,639
Because we forced him.

16
03:27:29,889 --> 03:27:34,686
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland.
