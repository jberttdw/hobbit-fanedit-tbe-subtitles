1
03:14:53,609 --> 03:14:56,195
MAN 1: These children are starving.
MAN 2: We need food.

2
03:14:56,445 --> 03:14:58,614
MAN 1: We won't last three days.
PERCY: Bard...

3
03:14:58,864 --> 03:15:01,367
- ...we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.

4
03:15:02,702 --> 03:15:04,662
PERCY:
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

5
03:15:05,204 --> 03:15:06,872
WOMAN:
We need more water.

6
03:15:07,123 --> 03:15:09,458
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.

7
03:15:09,709 --> 03:15:10,876
MAN 3:
Here you are.

8
03:15:11,836 --> 03:15:12,837
BARD:
Good morning, Alfrid.

9
03:15:13,796 --> 03:15:15,298
What news from the night watch?

10
03:15:15,548 --> 03:15:18,092
All quiet, sire. Not much to report.

11
03:15:18,634 --> 03:15:20,511
Nothing gets past me.

12
03:15:27,601 --> 03:15:30,688
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.

13
03:16:03,888 --> 03:16:06,182
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...

14
03:16:06,432 --> 03:16:08,809
- ...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.

15
03:16:16,817 --> 03:16:18,694
[CHATTERING]

16
03:16:27,703 --> 03:16:28,871
Here you go.

17
03:16:30,122 --> 03:16:31,332
MAN 1:
Pass it back.

18
03:16:32,208 --> 03:16:33,334
MAN 2:
Another one.

19
03:16:37,380 --> 03:16:38,381
BARD:
You have saved us.

20
03:16:39,131 --> 03:16:40,591
I do not know how to thank you.

21
03:16:40,841 --> 03:16:42,676
Your gratitude is misplaced.

22
03:16:43,511 --> 03:16:45,471
I did not come on your behalf.

23
03:16:45,721 --> 03:16:48,599
I came to reclaim something of mine.

24
03:16:55,815 --> 03:16:59,276
<i>There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.</i>

25
03:17:00,069 --> 03:17:03,155
<i>White gems of pure starlight.</i>

26
03:17:03,906 --> 03:17:06,283
The White Gems of Lasgalen.

27
03:17:08,202 --> 03:17:11,163
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.

28
03:17:17,128 --> 03:17:18,754
BARD:
Wait! Please wait!

29
03:17:22,216 --> 03:17:24,635
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?

30
03:17:24,885 --> 03:17:28,472
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

31
03:17:28,722 --> 03:17:30,224
We are allies in this.

32
03:17:31,725 --> 03:17:32,476
My people...

33
03:17:32,726 --> 03:17:35,438
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.

34
03:17:35,980 --> 03:17:36,730
Let me...

35
03:17:36,981 --> 03:17:38,232
...speak with Thorin.

36
03:17:38,816 --> 03:17:41,235
You would try to reason with the Dwarf?

37
03:17:41,485 --> 03:17:42,820
To avoid war?

38
03:17:43,654 --> 03:17:44,697
Yes.

39
03:17:45,573 --> 03:17:47,491
GLOIN:
Not a bad night's work.

40
03:17:49,577 --> 03:17:50,828
Come on.

41
03:18:13,517 --> 03:18:16,103
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.

42
03:18:16,353 --> 03:18:18,856
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

43
03:18:19,106 --> 03:18:20,566
Why do you come to the gates...

44
03:18:20,816 --> 03:18:23,277
...of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?

45
03:18:23,527 --> 03:18:26,405
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...

46
03:18:27,114 --> 03:18:29,450
...like a robber in his hold?

47
03:18:30,117 --> 03:18:33,204
THORIN: Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.

48
03:18:34,246 --> 03:18:35,289
BARD:
My lord...

49
03:18:36,165 --> 03:18:38,125
...we have not come to rob you...

50
03:18:38,375 --> 03:18:40,628
...but to seek fair settlement.

51
03:18:41,253 --> 03:18:43,172
Will you not speak with me?

52
03:19:01,982 --> 03:19:02,858
[CAWING]

53
03:19:18,207 --> 03:19:19,542
I am listening.

54
03:19:20,626 --> 03:19:22,461
On behalf of the people of Lake-town...

55
03:19:22,711 --> 03:19:24,755
...I ask that you honor your pledge.

56
03:19:25,381 --> 03:19:26,674
A share of the treasure...

57
03:19:26,924 --> 03:19:28,926
...so that they might rebuild their lives.

58
03:19:29,843 --> 03:19:32,137
I will not treat with any man...

59
03:19:32,680 --> 03:19:35,140
...while an armed host lies before my door.

60
03:19:35,391 --> 03:19:39,061
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.

61
03:19:40,354 --> 03:19:43,107
And your threats do not sway me.

62
03:19:44,942 --> 03:19:46,402
What of your conscience?

63
03:19:46,986 --> 03:19:49,822
Does it not tell you our cause is just?

64
03:19:51,198 --> 03:19:53,742
My people offered you help.

65
03:19:55,744 --> 03:19:59,331
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

66
03:19:59,582 --> 03:20:02,793
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?

67
03:20:03,043 --> 03:20:04,336
A bargain was struck!

68
03:20:04,587 --> 03:20:05,796
A bargain?

69
03:20:06,046 --> 03:20:08,924
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright...

70
03:20:09,174 --> 03:20:10,968
...for blankets and food?
To ransom...

71
03:20:11,218 --> 03:20:13,429
...our future in exchange
for our freedom?

72
03:20:14,263 --> 03:20:16,473
You call that a fair trade?

73
03:20:18,601 --> 03:20:19,935
Tell me...
