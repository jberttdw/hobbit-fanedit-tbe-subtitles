1
03:14:53,219 --> 03:14:55,805
MAN 1: These children are starving.
MAN 2: We need food.

2
03:14:56,055 --> 03:14:58,224
MAN 1: We won't last three days.
PERCY: Bard...

3
03:14:58,474 --> 03:15:00,977
- ...we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.

4
03:15:02,312 --> 03:15:04,272
PERCY:
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

5
03:15:04,814 --> 03:15:06,482
WOMAN:
We need more water.

6
03:15:06,733 --> 03:15:09,068
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.

7
03:15:09,319 --> 03:15:10,486
MAN 3:
Here you are.

8
03:15:11,446 --> 03:15:12,447
BARD:
Good morning, Alfrid.

9
03:15:13,406 --> 03:15:14,908
What news from the night watch?

10
03:15:15,158 --> 03:15:17,702
All quiet, sire. Not much to report.

11
03:15:18,244 --> 03:15:20,121
Nothing gets past me.

12
03:15:27,211 --> 03:15:30,298
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.

13
03:16:03,498 --> 03:16:05,792
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...

14
03:16:06,042 --> 03:16:08,419
- ...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.

15
03:16:16,427 --> 03:16:18,304
[CHATTERING]

16
03:16:27,313 --> 03:16:28,481
Here you go.

17
03:16:29,732 --> 03:16:30,942
MAN 1:
Pass it back.

18
03:16:31,818 --> 03:16:32,944
MAN 2:
Another one.

19
03:16:36,990 --> 03:16:37,991
BARD:
You have saved us.

20
03:16:38,741 --> 03:16:40,201
I do not know how to thank you.

21
03:16:40,451 --> 03:16:42,286
Your gratitude is misplaced.

22
03:16:43,121 --> 03:16:45,081
I did not come on your behalf.

23
03:16:45,331 --> 03:16:48,209
I came to reclaim something of mine.

24
03:16:55,425 --> 03:16:58,886
<i>There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.</i>

25
03:16:59,679 --> 03:17:02,765
<i>White gems of pure starlight.</i>

26
03:17:03,516 --> 03:17:05,893
The White Gems of Lasgalen.

27
03:17:07,812 --> 03:17:10,773
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.

28
03:17:16,738 --> 03:17:18,364
BARD:
Wait! Please wait!

29
03:17:21,826 --> 03:17:24,245
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?

30
03:17:24,495 --> 03:17:28,082
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

31
03:17:28,332 --> 03:17:29,834
We are allies in this.

32
03:17:31,335 --> 03:17:32,086
My people...

33
03:17:32,336 --> 03:17:35,048
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.

34
03:17:35,590 --> 03:17:36,340
Let me...

35
03:17:36,591 --> 03:17:37,842
...speak with Thorin.

36
03:17:38,426 --> 03:17:40,845
You would try to reason with the Dwarf?

37
03:17:41,095 --> 03:17:42,430
To avoid war?

38
03:17:43,264 --> 03:17:44,307
Yes.

39
03:17:45,183 --> 03:17:47,101
GLOIN:
Not a bad night's work.

40
03:17:49,187 --> 03:17:50,438
Come on.

41
03:18:13,127 --> 03:18:15,713
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.

42
03:18:15,963 --> 03:18:18,466
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

43
03:18:18,716 --> 03:18:20,176
Why do you come to the gates...

44
03:18:20,426 --> 03:18:22,887
...of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?

45
03:18:23,137 --> 03:18:26,015
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...

46
03:18:26,724 --> 03:18:29,060
...like a robber in his hold?

47
03:18:29,727 --> 03:18:32,814
THORIN: Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.

48
03:18:33,856 --> 03:18:34,899
BARD:
My lord...

49
03:18:35,775 --> 03:18:37,735
...we have not come to rob you...

50
03:18:37,985 --> 03:18:40,238
...but to seek fair settlement.

51
03:18:40,863 --> 03:18:42,782
Will you not speak with me?

52
03:19:01,592 --> 03:19:02,468
[CAWING]

53
03:19:17,817 --> 03:19:19,152
I am listening.

54
03:19:20,236 --> 03:19:22,071
On behalf of the people of Lake-town...

55
03:19:22,321 --> 03:19:24,365
...I ask that you honor your pledge.

56
03:19:24,991 --> 03:19:26,284
A share of the treasure...

57
03:19:26,534 --> 03:19:28,536
...so that they might rebuild their lives.

58
03:19:29,453 --> 03:19:31,747
I will not treat with any man...

59
03:19:32,290 --> 03:19:34,750
...while an armed host lies before my door.

60
03:19:35,001 --> 03:19:38,671
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.

61
03:19:39,964 --> 03:19:42,717
And your threats do not sway me.

62
03:19:44,552 --> 03:19:46,012
What of your conscience?

63
03:19:46,596 --> 03:19:49,432
Does it not tell you our cause is just?

64
03:19:50,808 --> 03:19:53,352
My people offered you help.

65
03:19:55,354 --> 03:19:58,941
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

66
03:19:59,192 --> 03:20:02,403
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?

67
03:20:02,653 --> 03:20:03,946
A bargain was struck!

68
03:20:04,197 --> 03:20:05,406
A bargain?

69
03:20:05,656 --> 03:20:08,534
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright...

70
03:20:08,784 --> 03:20:10,578
...for blankets and food?
To ransom...

71
03:20:10,828 --> 03:20:13,039
...our future in exchange
for our freedom?

72
03:20:13,873 --> 03:20:16,083
You call that a fair trade?

73
03:20:18,211 --> 03:20:19,545
Tell me...
