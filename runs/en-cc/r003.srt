[THORIN YELLS]

519
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:29,094
[AZOG SCREAMING]

520
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:33,890
Azog the Defiler learned that day...

521
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:38,853
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

[THORIN SHOUTING IN DWARVISH]

523
00:37:54,912 --> 00:37:56,871
[ALL YELLING]

524
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:08,341
Our forces rallied...

525
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:12,012
...and drove the Orcs back.

526
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:15,181
And our enemy...

527
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:17,976
...had been defeated.

528
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:21,813
But there was no feast...

529
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:25,275
...nor song that night...

530
00:38:25,443 --> 00:38:30,238
...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.

531
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:34,659
We few had survived.

532
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:44,753
And I thought to myself then...

533
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:51,801
...there is one who I could follow.

534
00:38:54,013 --> 00:38:56,139
There is one...

535
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:58,808
...I could call king.

536
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:19,120
And the pale Orc?

537
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,999
What happened to him?

538
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:26,711
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.

539
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:30,757
That filth died of his wounds long ago.
