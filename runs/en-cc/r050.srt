1
01:49:31,115 --> 01:49:33,357
Ah, Bilbo.
There you are.

2
01:49:33,635 --> 01:49:37,485
Now, this will require some delicate handling.

3
01:49:37,715 --> 01:49:39,763
We must tread very carefully.

4
01:49:39,995 --> 01:49:44,000
The last person to have startled him
was torn to shreds.

5
01:49:46,315 --> 01:49:48,635
I will go first and uh, Bilbo?

6
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:50,604
You come with me.

7
01:49:51,875 --> 01:49:54,643
- Is this a good idea?
GANDALF: Yes.

8
01:49:54,715 --> 01:49:57,002
Now, the rest of you, you just wait here...

9
01:49:57,235 --> 01:49:59,806
...and don't come out until I give the signal.
BOFUR: Right.

10
01:50:00,035 --> 01:50:01,275
Wait for the signal.

11
01:50:01,515 --> 01:50:04,837
And no sudden moves or loud noises,
and don't overcrowd him.

12
01:50:05,075 --> 01:50:07,396
And only come out in pairs. Right.

13
01:50:07,675 --> 01:50:09,748
No, actually, Bombur...

14
01:50:10,755 --> 01:50:12,837
...um, you count as two
so you should come out alone.

15
01:50:13,075 --> 01:50:14,122
Mm.

16
01:50:15,315 --> 01:50:17,921
Remember, wait for the signal.

17
01:50:18,155 --> 01:50:20,840
BOFUR:
The signal. Right.

18
01:50:21,075 --> 01:50:22,115
What signal would that be?

19
01:50:38,155 --> 01:50:40,532
GANDALF: Ahem.
- You're nervous.

20
01:50:43,675 --> 01:50:46,884
Nervous? What nonsense.

21
01:50:47,355 --> 01:50:48,766
Good morning.

22
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:56,684
Good morning!

23
01:50:59,515 --> 01:51:00,960
BEORN:
Who are you?

24
01:51:01,195 --> 01:51:04,995
I'm Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

25
01:51:09,835 --> 01:51:11,724
Never heard of him.

26
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:16,398
I'm a Wizard.

27
01:51:16,475 --> 01:51:19,282
Perhaps you've heard of
my colleague Radagast the Brown.

28
01:51:19,395 --> 01:51:22,399
He resides in the southern
borders of Mirkwood.

29
01:51:22,799 --> 01:51:24,927
What do you want?

30
01:51:24,995 --> 01:51:28,556
Well, simply to thank you
for your hospitality.

31
01:51:28,835 --> 01:51:30,656
You may have noticed that we took refuge...

32
01:51:30,715 --> 01:51:33,289
...in your lodgings here last night.

33
01:51:34,155 --> 01:51:36,315
Who is this little fellow?

34
01:51:36,395 --> 01:51:39,882
Well, this would be
Mr. Baggins from the Shire.

35
01:51:41,955 --> 01:51:44,548
He's not a Dwarf, is he?

36
01:51:44,755 --> 01:51:48,233
Why, no. No, he's a Hobbit.

37
01:51:48,235 --> 01:51:51,796
A good family
and unimpeachable reputation.

38
01:51:52,035 --> 01:51:55,437
A Halfling and a Wizard.

39
01:51:56,593 --> 01:51:57,833
How come you here?

40
01:51:57,835 --> 01:52:00,996
GANDALF: Oh, well, the fact is
that we've had a bad time of it...

41
01:52:01,235 --> 01:52:04,079
...from Goblins in the mountains.

42
01:52:04,192 --> 01:52:05,918
What did you go near Goblins for?

43
01:52:05,955 --> 01:52:07,445
Stupid thing to do.

44
01:52:07,715 --> 01:52:08,921
You are absolutely right...

45
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:10,236
- There it is. Go. Go.

46
01:52:10,475 --> 01:52:12,762
GANDALF:
It was terrible.

47
01:52:22,309 --> 01:52:24,276
DWALIN:
Dwalin, and Balin.

48
01:52:24,517 --> 01:52:27,403
GANDALF:
And I, uh, I must confess that,  uh...

49
01:52:27,635 --> 01:52:31,159
...several of our group are, in fact, Dwarves.

50
01:52:31,195 --> 01:52:36,036
Do you call two...
"several"?

51
01:52:36,275 --> 01:52:38,846
Well, uh, now you put it that way...

52
01:52:39,115 --> 01:52:40,844
[STUTTERING]

53
01:52:41,315 --> 01:52:43,642
Yes, there could be more than two.

54
01:52:44,395 --> 01:52:45,484
BOFUR:
Go, go.

55
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:47,050
GLOIN:
Wait, that's us.

56
01:52:50,395 --> 01:52:53,279
GANDALF: Oh, and here are some more
of our, uh, happy troop.

57
01:52:53,515 --> 01:52:55,722
And do you call six a "troop"?

58
01:52:56,190 --> 01:52:56,793
[LAUGHS]

59
01:52:56,795 --> 01:52:59,196
What are you, a traveling circus?

60
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:02,356
BOFUR:
Go. Go. Go, go.

61
01:53:05,635 --> 01:53:09,678
Dori and Ori at your service.

62
01:53:09,764 --> 01:53:11,392
BEORN:
I don't want your service.

63
01:53:11,502 --> 01:53:13,059
Absolutely understandable.

64
01:53:13,294 --> 01:53:14,602
Go. Go.

65
01:53:17,235 --> 01:53:20,563
Oh, Fili and Kili. I'd quite forgotten. Yes.

66
01:53:21,135 --> 01:53:25,344
Oh, yes, and uh, Nori, Bofur,
Bifur...

67
01:53:26,995 --> 01:53:28,645
...and Bombur.

68
01:53:29,795 --> 01:53:31,399
Is that it?

69
01:53:34,195 --> 01:53:35,720
Are there any more?

70
01:53:43,035 --> 01:53:44,082
Ah.

71
01:53:47,995 --> 01:53:51,761
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.
