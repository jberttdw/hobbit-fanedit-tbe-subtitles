03:46:56,981 --> 03:46:59,191
My children! Where are my children?

2
03:46:59,442 --> 03:47:02,361
I saw them!
They were down in the old market!

3
03:47:02,611 --> 03:47:03,821
The market?

4
03:47:04,321 --> 03:47:05,739
Where are they now?

5
03:47:05,990 --> 03:47:07,575
Tilda! Sigrid!

6
03:47:07,825 --> 03:47:10,494
Bard! Orcs are storming over the causeway!

7
03:47:11,412 --> 03:47:14,748
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them off as long as you can.

8
03:47:14,999 --> 03:47:17,001
Archers! This way!

9
03:47:17,251 --> 03:47:19,462
The Orcs have taken Stone Street!

10
03:47:19,712 --> 03:47:21,422
The market's overrun!

11
03:47:24,717 --> 03:47:26,260
The rest of you...

12
03:47:26,510 --> 03:47:27,845
...follow me!
