03:46:57,371 --> 03:46:59,581
My children! Where are my children?

2
03:46:59,832 --> 03:47:02,751
I saw them!
They were down in the old market!

3
03:47:03,001 --> 03:47:04,211
The market?

4
03:47:04,711 --> 03:47:06,129
Where are they now?

5
03:47:06,380 --> 03:47:07,965
Tilda! Sigrid!

6
03:47:08,215 --> 03:47:10,884
Bard! Orcs are storming over the causeway!

7
03:47:11,802 --> 03:47:15,138
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them off as long as you can.

8
03:47:15,389 --> 03:47:17,391
Archers! This way!

9
03:47:17,641 --> 03:47:19,852
The Orcs have taken Stone Street!

10
03:47:20,102 --> 03:47:21,812
The market's overrun!

11
03:47:25,107 --> 03:47:26,650
The rest of you...

12
03:47:26,900 --> 03:47:28,235
...follow me!
