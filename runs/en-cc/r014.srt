01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,601
THORIN:
Our business is no concern of Elves.

2
01:02:54,768 --> 01:02:57,729
GANDALF: For goodness sake, Thorin,
show him the map.

3
01:02:57,896 --> 01:02:59,939
lt is the legacy of my people.

4
01:03:00,107 --> 01:03:03,693
lt is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

5
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:06,404
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.

6
01:03:06,572 --> 01:03:09,532
Your pride will be your downfall.

7
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,577
You stand here in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...

8
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:16,414
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

9
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:25,298
Thorin, no.

10
01:03:34,725 --> 01:03:36,309
Erebor.

11
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:41,397
What is your interest in this map?

12
01:03:42,858 --> 01:03:44,150
It's mainly academic.

13
01:03:44,818 --> 01:03:49,614
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

14
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,789
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?

15
01:04:03,587 --> 01:04:05,171
[ELROND SPEAKS IN ELVISH]

16
01:04:05,923 --> 01:04:08,341
Moon runes?

17
01:04:08,509 --> 01:04:10,176
Of course.

18
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:12,929
An easy thing to miss.

19
01:04:13,097 --> 01:04:14,681
ELROND:
Well, in this case, that is true.

20
01:04:14,848 --> 01:04:17,350
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

21
01:04:17,518 --> 01:04:21,938
...of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written.

22
01:04:22,773 --> 01:04:24,524
Can you read them?

23
01:04:29,113 --> 01:04:32,198
ELROND: These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

24
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:36,619
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.

25
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:40,081
lt would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

26
01:04:40,999 --> 01:04:43,000
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.

27
01:04:43,168 --> 01:04:47,046
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

28
01:05:05,816 --> 01:05:10,445
"Stand by the gray stone
when the thrush knocks...

29
01:05:10,612 --> 01:05:15,366
...and the setting sun with the last light
of Durin's Day...

30
01:05:15,534 --> 01:05:19,912
-...will shine upon the keyhole."
-Durin's Day?

31
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,541
lt is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...

32
01:05:23,709 --> 01:05:26,586
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

33
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:28,671
This is ill news.

34
01:05:28,839 --> 01:05:31,382
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

35
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:32,842
We still have time.

36
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:35,470
-Time? For what?
-To find the entrance.

37
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:39,432
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.

38
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,603
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

39
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:47,106
So this is your purpose,
to enter the mountain?

40
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:49,358
What of it?

41
01:05:49,526 --> 01:05:52,487
There are some
who would not deem it wise.

42
01:05:54,114 --> 01:05:55,198
What do you mean?

43
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:01,245
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.
