They could not have moved in daylight.

2
00:52:39,461 --> 00:52:41,837
There must be a cave nearby.

[INSECTS BUZZING]

NORI:
Oh, what's that stench?

5
00:52:54,935 --> 00:52:58,103
GANDALF:
It's a Troll-hoard.

6
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,065
Be careful what you touch.

[DWARVES COUGHING]

8
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:16,580
Seems a shame
just to leave it lying around.

9
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:20,626
-Anyone could take it.
-Agreed.

10
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:22,461
-Nori.
NORI: Yeah?

11
00:53:22,629 --> 00:53:24,004
Get a shovel.

12
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:43,315
These swords were not made by any Troll.

13
00:53:49,322 --> 00:53:53,576
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.

14
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,332
These were forged in Gondolin...

15
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,003
...by the High Elves of the First Age.

16
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:06,714
You could not wish for a finer blade.

00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:22,521
BOFUR: Set it down.
GLOIN: That's good.

18
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:25,149
BOFUR:
All right, come on. Quick.

19
00:54:33,491 --> 00:54:36,160
We're making a long-term deposit.

THORIN:
Let's get out of this foul place.

21
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,497
Come on, let's go.

00:54:40,665 --> 00:54:42,625
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

BILBO: Hmm?

24
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:06,357
Here.

25
00:55:06,524 --> 00:55:09,068
This is about your size.

26
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:16,116
I can't take this.

27
00:55:16,493 --> 00:55:18,494
The blade is of Elvish make...

28
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:23,624
...which means it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

29
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:27,127
I have never used a sword in my life.

30
00:55:27,295 --> 00:55:29,296
And I hope you never have to.

31
00:55:30,215 --> 00:55:31,882
But if you do, remember this:

32
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:38,597
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

33
00:55:39,265 --> 00:55:41,475
...but when to spare one.
