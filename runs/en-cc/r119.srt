[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

03:48:54,181 --> 03:48:56,017
DWALIN:
Since when do we forsake...

5
03:48:56,267 --> 03:48:57,435
...our own people?

6
03:48:57,685 --> 03:48:58,519
Thorin...

7
03:48:59,437 --> 03:49:00,438
...they are dying...

8
03:49:00,688 --> 03:49:01,856
...out there.

9
03:49:07,194 --> 03:49:10,448
There are halls beneath halls
within this Mountain.

10
03:49:12,575 --> 03:49:14,702
Places we can fortify...

11
03:49:15,995 --> 03:49:17,622
...shore up, make safe.

12
03:49:17,872 --> 03:49:19,040
Yes.

13
03:49:20,708 --> 03:49:21,709
Yes...

14
03:49:22,918 --> 03:49:23,919
...that is it.

15
03:49:24,879 --> 03:49:26,881
We must move the gold
further underground...

16
03:49:27,131 --> 03:49:28,507
- ...to safety.
- Did you hear me?

17
03:49:28,758 --> 03:49:30,926
Dain is surrounded.

18
03:49:31,177 --> 03:49:32,887
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

19
03:49:35,389 --> 03:49:36,849
Many die in war.

20
03:49:38,100 --> 03:49:39,685
Life is cheap.

21
03:49:41,812 --> 03:49:42,813
But a treasure...

22
03:49:43,064 --> 03:49:45,024
...such as this cannot be counted...

23
03:49:45,274 --> 03:49:46,942
...in lives lost.

24
03:49:50,029 --> 03:49:51,530
It is worth...

25
03:49:51,781 --> 03:49:54,283
...all the blood we can spend.

26
03:49:55,951 --> 03:49:58,371
You sit here in these vast halls...

27
03:49:58,621 --> 03:50:01,082
...with a crown upon your head...

28
03:50:01,832 --> 03:50:04,919
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

29
03:50:06,754 --> 03:50:08,673
Do not speak to me...

30
03:50:10,341 --> 03:50:12,385
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...

31
03:50:14,261 --> 03:50:15,221
...as if...

32
03:50:15,471 --> 03:50:17,932
...I were still...

03:50:20,935 --> 03:50:22,436
...Thorin...

- I am your king!
- You were always my king.

36
03:50:30,027 --> 03:50:31,904
You used to know that once.

37
03:50:33,239 --> 03:50:35,825
You cannot see what you have become.

38
03:50:39,286 --> 03:50:40,496
Go.

39
03:50:43,249 --> 03:50:44,542
Get out.

40
03:50:47,044 --> 03:50:48,879

<i>And ours alone.</i>

03:51:26,625 --> 03:51:29,170
<i>I will not part...</i>
