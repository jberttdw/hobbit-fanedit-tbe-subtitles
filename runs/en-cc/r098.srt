03:12:54,270 --> 03:12:55,021
BOFUR:
Up it goes!

2
03:12:59,108 --> 03:13:00,276
DWALIN:
That's it.

3
03:13:03,863 --> 03:13:06,073
I want this fortress made safe by sunup.

4
03:13:06,949 --> 03:13:08,492
This Mountain was hard-won.

5
03:13:08,743 --> 03:13:10,661
I will not see it taken again.

6
03:13:10,911 --> 03:13:13,039
The people of Lake-town have nothing.

7
03:13:13,289 --> 03:13:14,665
They came to us in need.

8
03:13:14,915 --> 03:13:17,376
They have lost everything.

9
03:13:17,627 --> 03:13:20,755
Do not tell me what they have lost.

10
03:13:21,631 --> 03:13:24,050
I know well enough their hardship.

11
03:13:25,468 --> 03:13:27,678
Those who have lived through dragon fire...

12
03:13:27,928 --> 03:13:29,138
...should rejoice.

13
03:13:30,473 --> 03:13:31,307
They have much...

14
03:13:31,557 --> 03:13:32,892
...to be grateful for.

15
03:13:38,230 --> 03:13:39,357
More stone.

16
03:13:42,234 --> 03:13:44,362
Bring more stone to the gate!

17
03:13:44,612 --> 03:13:45,655
DWALIN:
That's it.
