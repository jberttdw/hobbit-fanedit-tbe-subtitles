03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:55,391
BOFUR:
Up it goes!

2
03:12:59,478 --> 03:13:00,646
DWALIN:
That's it.

3
03:13:04,233 --> 03:13:06,443
I want this fortress made safe by sunup.

4
03:13:07,319 --> 03:13:08,862
This Mountain was hard-won.

5
03:13:09,113 --> 03:13:11,031
I will not see it taken again.

6
03:13:11,281 --> 03:13:13,409
The people of Lake-town have nothing.

7
03:13:13,659 --> 03:13:15,035
They came to us in need.

8
03:13:15,285 --> 03:13:17,746
They have lost everything.

9
03:13:17,997 --> 03:13:21,125
Do not tell me what they have lost.

10
03:13:22,001 --> 03:13:24,420
I know well enough their hardship.

11
03:13:25,838 --> 03:13:28,048
Those who have lived through dragon fire...

12
03:13:28,298 --> 03:13:29,508
...should rejoice.

13
03:13:30,843 --> 03:13:31,677
They have much...

14
03:13:31,927 --> 03:13:33,262
...to be grateful for.

15
03:13:38,600 --> 03:13:39,727
More stone.

16
03:13:42,604 --> 03:13:44,732
Bring more stone to the gate!

17
03:13:44,982 --> 03:13:46,025
DWALIN:
That's it.
