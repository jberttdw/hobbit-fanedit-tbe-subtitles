03:08:22,783 --> 03:08:24,785
THORIN:
It is here in these halls.

2
03:08:25,036 --> 03:08:26,078
I know it.

3
03:08:26,329 --> 03:08:28,122
DWALIN:
We have searched and searched.

4
03:08:28,372 --> 03:08:29,290
THORIN:
Not well enough.

5
03:08:29,540 --> 03:08:31,918
DWALIN:
Thorin, we all would see the stone returned.

6
03:08:32,168 --> 03:08:35,087
THORIN:
And yet, it is still not found!

7
03:08:37,924 --> 03:08:41,844
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

8
03:08:50,645 --> 03:08:52,396
The Arkenstone...

9
03:08:53,314 --> 03:08:55,441
...is the birthright of our people.

10
03:08:56,192 --> 03:08:59,111
It is The King's Jewel.

11
03:09:00,488 --> 03:09:01,989
Am I not the king?

12
03:09:13,334 --> 03:09:14,835
Know this:

13
03:09:18,297 --> 03:09:20,549
If anyone should find it...

14
03:09:21,384 --> 03:09:23,386
...and withhold it from me...

15
03:09:25,221 --> 03:09:27,098
...I will be avenged.

16
03:09:36,440 --> 03:09:38,442
[SIGHING]

17
03:09:42,697 --> 03:09:44,240
Dragon-sickness.

18
03:09:45,741 --> 03:09:47,410
I've seen it before.

19
03:09:49,245 --> 03:09:50,663
That look.

20
03:09:51,163 --> 03:09:52,873
The terrible need.

21
03:09:54,208 --> 03:09:57,336
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.

22
03:10:00,214 --> 03:10:02,049
It sent his grandfather mad.

23
03:10:03,801 --> 03:10:05,678
Balin, if Thorin...

24
03:10:06,762 --> 03:10:08,514
...had the Arkenstone...

25
03:10:09,807 --> 03:10:10,516
...or if...

26
03:10:10,766 --> 03:10:11,726
...it was found...

27
03:10:14,311 --> 03:10:15,813
...would it help?

28
03:10:18,441 --> 03:10:22,153
That stone crowns all.

29
03:10:23,320 --> 03:10:26,198
It is the summit of this great wealth...

30
03:10:26,449 --> 03:10:27,491
...bestowing power...

31
03:10:27,742 --> 03:10:29,702
...upon he who bears it.

32
03:10:29,952 --> 03:10:31,871
Would it stay his madness?

33
03:10:33,539 --> 03:10:34,832
No, laddie.

34
03:10:37,001 --> 03:10:38,711
I fear it would make him worse.

35
03:10:41,547 --> 03:10:43,257
Perhaps it is best...

36
03:10:44,383 --> 03:10:46,052
...it remains lost.

37
03:10:59,857 --> 03:11:01,150
THORIN:
What is that?

38
03:11:02,610 --> 03:11:04,153
In your hand.

39
03:11:04,403 --> 03:11:05,071
It's nothing.

40
03:11:05,696 --> 03:11:06,947
Show me.

41
03:11:08,616 --> 03:11:09,909
It...

42
03:11:16,874 --> 03:11:19,418
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

43
03:11:23,422 --> 03:11:25,257
You've carried it all this way?

44
03:11:25,508 --> 03:11:27,301
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.

45
03:11:27,551 --> 03:11:29,136
In Bag End.

46
03:11:31,806 --> 03:11:34,934
It's a poor prize to take back to the Shire.

47
03:11:36,769 --> 03:11:38,104
One day, it'll grow.

48
03:11:39,897 --> 03:11:42,191
And every time I look at it, I'll remember.

49
03:11:43,567 --> 03:11:46,237
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...

50
03:11:47,321 --> 03:11:49,448
...and how lucky I am that I made it home.

51
03:11:58,707 --> 03:12:00,292
Thorin, I...

52
03:12:00,543 --> 03:12:01,794
DWALIN:
Thorin.

53
03:12:02,044 --> 03:12:04,130
Survivors from Lake-town...

54
03:12:04,672 --> 03:12:06,549
...they're streaming into Dale.

55
03:12:07,967 --> 03:12:09,677
There's hundreds of them.

56
03:12:11,345 --> 03:12:13,305
Call everyone to the gate.

57
03:12:14,557 --> 03:12:15,683
To the gate!

58
03:12:15,933 --> 03:12:16,976
Now!

59
03:12:18,310 --> 03:12:19,728
[CHATTERING]

60
03:12:48,007 --> 03:12:50,593
BARD: Come on. Keep moving.
