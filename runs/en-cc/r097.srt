03:08:22,493 --> 03:08:24,495
THORIN:
It is here in these halls.

2
03:08:24,746 --> 03:08:25,788
I know it.

3
03:08:26,039 --> 03:08:27,832
DWALIN:
We have searched and searched.

4
03:08:28,082 --> 03:08:29,000
THORIN:
Not well enough.

5
03:08:29,250 --> 03:08:31,628
DWALIN:
Thorin, we all would see the stone returned.

6
03:08:31,878 --> 03:08:34,797
THORIN:
And yet, it is still not found!

7
03:08:37,634 --> 03:08:41,554
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

8
03:08:50,355 --> 03:08:52,106
The Arkenstone...

9
03:08:53,024 --> 03:08:55,151
...is the birthright of our people.

10
03:08:55,902 --> 03:08:58,821
It is The King's Jewel.

11
03:09:00,198 --> 03:09:01,699
Am I not the king?

12
03:09:13,044 --> 03:09:14,545
Know this:

13
03:09:18,007 --> 03:09:20,259
If anyone should find it...

14
03:09:21,094 --> 03:09:23,096
...and withhold it from me...

15
03:09:24,931 --> 03:09:26,808
...I will be avenged.

16
03:09:36,150 --> 03:09:38,152
[SIGHING]

17
03:09:42,407 --> 03:09:43,950
Dragon-sickness.

18
03:09:45,451 --> 03:09:47,120
I've seen it before.

19
03:09:48,955 --> 03:09:50,373
That look.

20
03:09:50,873 --> 03:09:52,583
The terrible need.

21
03:09:53,918 --> 03:09:57,046
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.

22
03:09:59,924 --> 03:10:01,759
It sent his grandfather mad.

23
03:10:03,511 --> 03:10:05,388
Balin, if Thorin...

24
03:10:06,472 --> 03:10:08,224
...had the Arkenstone...

25
03:10:09,517 --> 03:10:10,226
...or if...

26
03:10:10,476 --> 03:10:11,436
...it was found...

27
03:10:14,021 --> 03:10:15,523
...would it help?

28
03:10:18,151 --> 03:10:21,863
That stone crowns all.

29
03:10:23,030 --> 03:10:25,908
It is the summit of this great wealth...

30
03:10:26,159 --> 03:10:27,201
...bestowing power...

31
03:10:27,452 --> 03:10:29,412
...upon he who bears it.

32
03:10:29,662 --> 03:10:31,581
Would it stay his madness?

33
03:10:33,249 --> 03:10:34,542
No, laddie.

34
03:10:36,711 --> 03:10:38,421
I fear it would make him worse.

35
03:10:41,257 --> 03:10:42,967
Perhaps it is best...

36
03:10:44,093 --> 03:10:45,762
...it remains lost.

37
03:10:59,567 --> 03:11:00,860
THORIN:
What is that?

38
03:11:02,320 --> 03:11:03,863
In your hand.

39
03:11:04,113 --> 03:11:04,781
It's nothing.

40
03:11:05,406 --> 03:11:06,657
Show me.

41
03:11:08,326 --> 03:11:09,619
It...

42
03:11:16,584 --> 03:11:19,128
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

43
03:11:23,132 --> 03:11:24,967
You've carried it all this way?

44
03:11:25,218 --> 03:11:27,011
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.

45
03:11:27,261 --> 03:11:28,846
In Bag End.

46
03:11:31,516 --> 03:11:34,644
It's a poor prize to take back to the Shire.

47
03:11:36,479 --> 03:11:37,814
One day, it'll grow.

48
03:11:39,607 --> 03:11:41,901
And every time I look at it, I'll remember.

49
03:11:43,277 --> 03:11:45,947
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...

50
03:11:47,031 --> 03:11:49,158
...and how lucky I am that I made it home.

51
03:11:58,417 --> 03:12:00,002
Thorin, I...

52
03:12:00,253 --> 03:12:01,504
DWALIN:
Thorin.

53
03:12:01,754 --> 03:12:03,840
Survivors from Lake-town...

54
03:12:04,382 --> 03:12:06,259
...they're streaming into Dale.

55
03:12:07,677 --> 03:12:09,387
There's hundreds of them.

56
03:12:11,055 --> 03:12:13,015
Call everyone to the gate.

57
03:12:14,267 --> 03:12:15,393
To the gate!

58
03:12:15,643 --> 03:12:16,686
Now!

59
03:12:18,020 --> 03:12:19,438
[CHATTERING]

60
03:12:47,717 --> 03:12:50,303
BARD: Come on. Keep moving.
