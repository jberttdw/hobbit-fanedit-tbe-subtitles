The Elven Gate.

01:56:08,052 --> 01:56:11,180
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

01:56:11,514 --> 01:56:14,559
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.

01:56:21,816 --> 01:56:23,943
Set the ponies loose.

5
01:56:24,402 --> 01:56:27,029
Let them return to their master.

BILBO:
This forest feels...

8
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:33,244
...sick.

9
01:56:33,745 --> 01:56:35,913
As if a disease lies upon it.

10
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:40,042
Is there no way around?

11
01:56:40,293 --> 01:56:42,754
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

12
01:56:43,004 --> 01:56:45,089
Or twice that distance...

13
01:56:46,048 --> 01:56:47,341
...south.
