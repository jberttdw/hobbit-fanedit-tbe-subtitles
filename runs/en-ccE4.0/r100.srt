1
03:14:03,419 --> 03:14:06,005
MAN 1: These children are starving.
MAN 2: We need food.

2
03:14:06,255 --> 03:14:08,424
MAN 1: We won't last three days.
PERCY: Bard...

3
03:14:08,674 --> 03:14:11,177
- ...we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.

4
03:14:12,512 --> 03:14:14,472
PERCY:
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

5
03:14:15,014 --> 03:14:16,682
WOMAN:
We need more water.

6
03:14:16,933 --> 03:14:19,268
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.

7
03:14:19,519 --> 03:14:20,686
MAN 3:
Here you are.

8
03:14:21,646 --> 03:14:22,647
BARD:
Good morning, Alfrid.

9
03:14:23,606 --> 03:14:25,108
What news from the night watch?

10
03:14:25,358 --> 03:14:27,902
All quiet, sire. Not much to report.

11
03:14:28,444 --> 03:14:30,321
Nothing gets past me.

12
03:14:37,411 --> 03:14:40,498
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.

13
03:15:13,698 --> 03:15:15,992
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...

14
03:15:16,242 --> 03:15:18,619
- ...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.

15
03:15:26,627 --> 03:15:28,504
[CHATTERING]

16
03:15:37,513 --> 03:15:38,681
Here you go.

17
03:15:39,932 --> 03:15:41,142
MAN 1:
Pass it back.

18
03:15:42,018 --> 03:15:43,144
MAN 2:
Another one.

19
03:15:47,190 --> 03:15:48,191
BARD:
You have saved us.

20
03:15:48,941 --> 03:15:50,401
I do not know how to thank you.

21
03:15:50,651 --> 03:15:52,486
Your gratitude is misplaced.

22
03:15:53,321 --> 03:15:55,281
I did not come on your behalf.

23
03:15:55,531 --> 03:15:58,409
I came to reclaim something of mine.

24
03:16:05,625 --> 03:16:09,086
<i>There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.</i>

25
03:16:09,879 --> 03:16:12,965
<i>White gems of pure starlight.</i>

26
03:16:13,716 --> 03:16:16,093
The White Gems of Lasgalen.

27
03:16:18,012 --> 03:16:20,973
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.

28
03:16:26,938 --> 03:16:28,564
BARD:
Wait! Please wait!

29
03:16:32,026 --> 03:16:34,445
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?

30
03:16:34,695 --> 03:16:38,282
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

31
03:16:38,532 --> 03:16:40,034
We are allies in this.

32
03:16:41,535 --> 03:16:42,286
My people...

33
03:16:42,536 --> 03:16:45,248
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.

34
03:16:45,790 --> 03:16:48,042
Let me speak with Thorin.

35
03:16:48,626 --> 03:16:51,045
You would try to reason with the Dwarf?

36
03:16:51,295 --> 03:16:52,630
To avoid war?

37
03:16:53,464 --> 03:16:54,507
Yes.

38
03:16:55,383 --> 03:16:57,301
GLOIN:
Not a bad night's work.

39
03:16:59,387 --> 03:17:00,638
Come on.

40
03:17:23,327 --> 03:17:25,913
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.

41
03:17:26,163 --> 03:17:28,666
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.

42
03:17:28,916 --> 03:17:33,087
Why do you come to the gates of the
King under the Mountain armed for war?

43
03:17:33,337 --> 03:17:36,215
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...

44
03:17:36,924 --> 03:17:39,260
...like a robber in his hold?

45
03:17:39,927 --> 03:17:43,014
THORIN: Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.

46
03:17:44,056 --> 03:17:45,099
BARD:
My lord...

47
03:17:45,975 --> 03:17:50,438
...we have not come to rob you,
but to seek fair settlement.

48
03:17:51,063 --> 03:17:52,982
Will you not speak with me?

49
03:18:11,792 --> 03:18:12,668
[CAWING]

50
03:18:28,017 --> 03:18:29,352
I am listening.

51
03:18:30,436 --> 03:18:34,565
On behalf of the people of Lake-town
I ask that you honor your pledge.

52
03:18:35,191 --> 03:18:38,736
A share of the treasure,
so that they might rebuild their lives.

53
03:18:39,653 --> 03:18:41,947
I will not treat with any man...

54
03:18:42,490 --> 03:18:44,950
...while an armed host lies before my door.

55
03:18:45,201 --> 03:18:48,871
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.

56
03:18:50,164 --> 03:18:52,917
And your threats do not sway me.

57
03:18:54,752 --> 03:18:56,212
What of your conscience?

58
03:18:56,796 --> 03:18:59,632
Does it not tell you our cause is just?

59
03:19:01,008 --> 03:19:03,552
My people offered you help.

60
03:19:05,554 --> 03:19:09,141
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

61
03:19:09,392 --> 03:19:12,603
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?

62
03:19:12,853 --> 03:19:14,146
A bargain was struck!

63
03:19:14,397 --> 03:19:15,606
A bargain?

64
03:19:15,856 --> 03:19:18,734
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright,

65
03:19:18,984 --> 03:19:20,778
for blankets and food?
To ransom

66
03:19:21,028 --> 03:19:23,239
our future in exchange
for our freedom?

67
03:19:24,073 --> 03:19:26,283
You call that a fair trade?

68
03:19:28,411 --> 03:19:29,745
Tell me...
