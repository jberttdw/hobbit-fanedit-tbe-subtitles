00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,114
The Valley of Imladris.

2
00:56:36,698 --> 00:56:40,576
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

3
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:42,870
Rivendell.

00:56:45,165 --> 00:56:50,086
GANDALF: Here lies the Last
Homely House East of the Sea.

5
00:56:51,338 --> 00:56:53,923
This was your plan all along.

6
00:56:54,466 --> 00:56:56,509
To seek refuge with our enemy.

7
00:56:56,718 --> 00:57:00,012
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

8
00:57:00,222 --> 00:57:04,100
The only ill will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself.

9
00:57:05,435 --> 00:57:08,604
You think the Elves will
give our quest their blessing?

10
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:11,190
They will try to stop us.

11
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,361
Of course they will. But we have
questions that need to be answered.

12
00:57:18,907 --> 00:57:22,461
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.

13
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:24,004
And respect.

14
00:57:24,204 --> 00:57:26,706
And no small degree of charm.

15
00:57:26,915 --> 00:57:30,918
Which is why you will
leave the talking to me.

00:58:27,392 --> 00:58:29,143
LINDIR:
Mithrandir.

17
00:58:29,895 --> 00:58:32,438
Ah. Lindir.

18
00:58:32,648 --> 00:58:34,190
Stay sharp.

20
00:58:37,694 --> 00:58:39,528
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

21
00:58:39,738 --> 00:58:41,656
[IN ENGLISH]
My Lord Elrond is not here.

22
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:43,908
Not here?

23
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:45,910
Where is he?
