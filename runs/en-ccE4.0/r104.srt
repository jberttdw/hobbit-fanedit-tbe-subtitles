1
03:25:58,686 --> 03:26:01,606
GANDALF: You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.

2
03:26:01,856 --> 03:26:02,899
War is coming!

3
03:26:03,149 --> 03:26:06,945
The cesspits of Dol Guldur
have been emptied.

4
03:26:07,195 --> 03:26:09,239
You're all in mortal danger.

5
03:26:09,489 --> 03:26:10,782
What are you talking about?

6
03:26:12,033 --> 03:26:14,619
I can see you know nothing of Wizards.

7
03:26:14,869 --> 03:26:17,121
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...

8
03:26:17,372 --> 03:26:20,875
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.

9
03:26:22,585 --> 03:26:26,547
But sometimes a storm is <i>just a storm.</i>

10
03:26:26,798 --> 03:26:28,299
Not this time.

11
03:26:28,549 --> 03:26:31,010
Armies of Orcs are on the move.

12
03:26:31,261 --> 03:26:33,596
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.

13
03:26:33,846 --> 03:26:36,474
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.

14
03:26:36,724 --> 03:26:38,268
Why show his hand now?

15
03:26:38,518 --> 03:26:39,769
Because we forced him.

16
03:26:40,019 --> 03:26:44,816
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland.
