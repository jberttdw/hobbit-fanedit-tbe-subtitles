[DWARVES SHOUTING]

03:33:01,243 --> 03:33:02,716
We have come to tell you...

4
03:33:02,967 --> 03:33:06,220
...payment of your debt has been offered...

5
03:33:06,470 --> 03:33:07,930
...and accepted.

6
03:33:09,390 --> 03:33:10,640
THORIN:
What payment?

7
03:33:11,559 --> 03:33:12,851
I gave you nothing.

8
03:33:13,602 --> 03:33:15,354
You have nothing.

9
03:33:22,278 --> 03:33:23,737
We have this.

10
03:33:27,616 --> 03:33:29,034
KILI:
They have the Arkenstone.

11
03:33:30,661 --> 03:33:31,787
Thieves!

12
03:33:32,413 --> 03:33:35,541
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?

13
03:33:35,791 --> 03:33:37,852
That stone belongs to the king!

14
03:33:38,877 --> 03:33:40,129
And the king may have it...

15
03:33:41,005 --> 03:33:42,506
...with our goodwill.

16
03:33:47,428 --> 03:33:51,390
But first he must honor his word.

17
03:33:53,851 --> 03:33:55,561
They are taking us for fools.

18
03:33:57,271 --> 03:33:58,647
This is a ruse.

19
03:34:00,232 --> 03:34:01,984
A filthy lie.

20
03:34:03,319 --> 03:34:06,238
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!

21
03:34:06,488 --> 03:34:07,664
It is a trick!

22
03:34:07,865 --> 03:34:09,491
BILBO:
It--It is no trick.

23
03:34:10,659 --> 03:34:11,952
The stone is real.

24
03:34:13,495 --> 03:34:15,080
I gave it to them.

25
03:34:23,297 --> 03:34:24,131
You?

26
03:34:26,675 --> 03:34:28,886
I took it as my 14th share.

27
03:34:30,763 --> 03:34:32,598
You would steal from me?

28
03:34:32,848 --> 03:34:34,746
Steal from you? No. No.

29
03:34:34,947 --> 03:34:37,689
I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.

30
03:34:40,689 --> 03:34:42,608
I'll let it stand against my claim.

31
03:34:43,108 --> 03:34:44,902
Against your claim?

32
03:34:46,654 --> 03:34:48,322
Your claim.

33
03:34:49,198 --> 03:34:53,001
You have no claim over me,
you miserable <i>rat!</i>

34
03:34:54,703 --> 03:34:56,580
I was going to give it to you.

35
03:34:57,581 --> 03:34:59,746
Many times I wanted to, but...

36
03:35:00,089 --> 03:35:02,086
- But what, thief?

37
03:35:02,433 --> 03:35:04,588
- You are changed, Thorin.

38
03:35:04,838 --> 03:35:08,967
The Dwarf I met in Bag End would
never have gone back on his word.

39
03:35:09,894 --> 03:35:12,262
Would never have doubted
the loyalty of his kin!

40
03:35:13,013 --> 03:35:15,265
Do not speak to me...

41
03:35:15,974 --> 03:35:17,309
...of loyalty.

42
03:35:20,896 --> 03:35:22,518
Throw him from the rampart!

43
03:35:31,407 --> 03:35:33,004
Did you not hear me?

44
03:35:36,036 --> 03:35:38,340
I will do it myself. Curse you!

45
03:35:38,566 --> 03:35:39,665
No!

46
03:35:39,915 --> 03:35:42,274
Cursed be the Wizard that
forced you on this company!

47
03:35:42,524 --> 03:35:46,505
- If you don't like my burglar
then please, don't damage him.

48
03:35:46,755 --> 03:35:48,755
Return him to me.

49
03:35:52,845 --> 03:35:59,059
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain, are you...

50
03:35:59,553 --> 03:36:02,354
... Thorin, son of Thrain?

51
03:36:08,783 --> 03:36:11,488
THORIN: Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!

52
03:36:11,739 --> 03:36:12,372
- Go!

53
03:36:12,573 --> 03:36:13,829
- Or Shire rats!

Are we resolved?

55
03:36:21,081 --> 03:36:24,293
The return of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?

56
03:36:30,591 --> 03:36:32,301
Give us your answer.

57
03:36:33,552 --> 03:36:35,137
Will you have peace...

58
03:36:36,889 --> 03:36:38,223
