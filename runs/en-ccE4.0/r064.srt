1
02:20:39,562 --> 02:20:40,812
BARD:
Do it again...

2
02:20:41,272 --> 02:20:42,522
...and you're dead.

3
02:20:45,068 --> 02:20:46,327
BALIN:
Excuse me...

4
02:20:46,528 --> 02:20:49,656
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

5
02:20:50,615 --> 02:20:53,118
That barge over there...

6
02:20:53,368 --> 02:20:56,663
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

7
02:20:58,331 --> 02:21:00,416
What makes you think I would help you?

8
02:21:00,667 --> 02:21:02,502
Those boots have seen better days.

9
02:21:03,086 --> 02:21:04,629
As has that coat.

10
02:21:05,713 --> 02:21:07,674
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

11
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:10,218
How many bairns?

12
02:21:11,136 --> 02:21:12,762
A boy and two girls.

13
02:21:13,763 --> 02:21:16,307
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

14
02:21:17,435 --> 02:21:18,685
BARD:
Aye.

15
02:21:19,144 --> 02:21:20,394
She was.

16
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:24,941
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

17
02:21:25,191 --> 02:21:28,123
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

18
02:21:28,736 --> 02:21:29,912
What's your hurry?

19
02:21:30,113 --> 02:21:31,367
What's it to you?

20
02:21:31,656 --> 02:21:33,303
I would like to know who you are...

21
02:21:34,364 --> 02:21:36,043
...and what you are doing in these lands.

22
02:21:36,244 --> 02:21:38,746
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

23
02:21:39,122 --> 02:21:42,417
...journeying to see our kin
in the Iron Hills.

24
02:21:43,793 --> 02:21:45,753
Simple merchants, you say?

25
02:21:46,004 --> 02:21:47,338
We need food...

26
02:21:47,589 --> 02:21:49,549
...supplies, weapons.

27
02:21:49,799 --> 02:21:51,049
Can you help us?

28
02:21:55,471 --> 02:21:57,765
BARD:
I know where these barrels came from.

29
02:21:58,516 --> 02:21:59,767
What of it?

30
02:22:00,018 --> 02:22:02,437
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

31
02:22:02,979 --> 02:22:04,689
...but I don't think it ended well.

32
02:22:06,357 --> 02:22:09,235
No one enters Lake-town
but by leave of the Master.

33
02:22:09,944 --> 02:22:12,655
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

34
02:22:12,906 --> 02:22:16,074
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

35
02:22:17,619 --> 02:22:18,869
Offer him more.

36
02:22:22,019 --> 02:22:24,520
BALIN: I'll wager there are
ways to enter that town unseen.

37
02:22:25,210 --> 02:22:26,294
Aye.

38
02:22:27,629 --> 02:22:28,880
But for that...

39
02:22:30,089 --> 02:22:31,466
...you would need a smuggler.

40
02:22:31,716 --> 02:22:33,635
For which we would pay double.
