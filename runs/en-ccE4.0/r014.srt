01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,561
THORIN:
Our business is no concern of Elves.

2
01:02:54,728 --> 01:02:57,689
GANDALF: For goodness sake, Thorin,
show him the map.

3
01:02:57,856 --> 01:02:59,899
It is the legacy of my people.

4
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:03,653
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.

5
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,364
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.

6
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,492
Your pride will be your downfall.

7
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,537
You stand here in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...

8
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:16,374
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

9
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,258
Thorin, no.

10
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,269
Erebor.

11
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:41,357
What is your interest in this map?

12
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:44,110
It's mainly academic.

13
01:03:44,778 --> 01:03:49,574
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

14
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,749
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?

15
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,131
[ELROND SPEAKS IN ELVISH]

16
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:08,301
Moon runes?

17
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,136
Of course.

18
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,889
An easy thing to miss.

19
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,641
ELROND:
Well, in this case, that is true.

20
01:04:14,808 --> 01:04:17,310
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

21
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:21,898
...of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written.

22
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,484
Can you read them?

23
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:32,158
ELROND: These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

24
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:36,579
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.

25
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:40,041
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

26
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,960
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.

27
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:47,006
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

28
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:10,405
"Stand by the gray stone
when the thrush knocks...

29
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:15,326
...and the setting sun with
the last light of Durin's Day...

30
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:19,872
- ...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?

31
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,501
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...

32
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,546
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

33
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,631
This is ill news.

34
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,342
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

35
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,802
We still have time.

36
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,430
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.

37
01:05:35,597 --> 01:05:39,392
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.

38
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,563
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

39
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:47,066
So this is your purpose,
to enter the mountain?

40
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,318
What of it?

41
01:05:49,486 --> 01:05:52,447
There are some
who would not deem it wise.

42
01:05:54,074 --> 01:05:55,158
What do you mean?

43
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:01,205
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.
