1
03:28:18,881 --> 03:28:22,301
GANDALF: Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?

2
03:28:22,551 --> 03:28:24,219
What do you think I'm trying to do?

3
03:28:24,470 --> 03:28:26,940
I think you're trying to
save your Dwarvish friends...

4
03:28:27,140 --> 03:28:29,475
...and I admire your loyalty to them...

5
03:28:29,725 --> 03:28:32,478
...but it does not dissuade
me from my course.

6
03:28:33,270 --> 03:28:35,647
You started this, Mithrandir.

7
03:28:36,231 --> 03:28:39,193
You will forgive me if I finish it.

8
03:28:39,443 --> 03:28:41,153
Are the archers in position?

9
03:28:42,029 --> 03:28:44,239
FEREN: Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.

10
03:28:44,865 --> 03:28:47,117
If anything moves on that Mountain...

11
03:28:47,368 --> 03:28:48,618
...kill it.

12
03:28:51,455 --> 03:28:53,749
The Dwarves are out of time.

13
03:29:20,552 --> 03:29:21,802
You, Bowman!

14
03:29:22,903 --> 03:29:26,448
Do you agree with this?
Is gold so important to you?

15
03:29:27,241 --> 03:29:29,743
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?

16
03:29:30,292 --> 03:29:31,544
It will not come to that.

17
03:29:31,745 --> 03:29:34,498
- This is a fight they cannot win.
BILBO: That won't stop them.

18
03:29:34,748 --> 03:29:37,668
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.

19
03:29:37,865 --> 03:29:39,794
They will fight to the
death to defend their own.

20
03:29:39,962 --> 03:29:41,422
Bilbo Baggins.

21
03:29:41,964 --> 03:29:45,767
THRANDUIL: If I'm not mistaken
this is the Halfling who stole the keys...

22
03:29:45,947 --> 03:29:49,847
...to my dungeons from
under the nose of my guards.

23
03:29:52,349 --> 03:29:53,434
<i>Yes.</i>

24
03:29:54,435 --> 03:29:56,603
Sorry about that.

25
03:29:57,856 --> 03:29:59,106
I came...

26
03:29:59,898 --> 03:30:02,151
...to give you this.

27
03:30:06,905 --> 03:30:08,782
The Heart of the Mountain.

28
03:30:10,535 --> 03:30:12,035
The King's Jewel.

29
03:30:13,495 --> 03:30:15,497
And worth a king's ransom.

30
03:30:17,416 --> 03:30:19,543
How is this yours to give?

31
03:30:19,793 --> 03:30:21,795
I took it as my 14th
share of the treasure.

32
03:30:23,422 --> 03:30:26,049
BARD:
Why would you do this? You owe us no loyalty.

33
03:30:26,300 --> 03:30:28,010
I'm not doing it for you.

34
03:30:29,779 --> 03:30:32,097
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate...

35
03:30:32,598 --> 03:30:33,891
...and pigheaded and...

36
03:30:34,600 --> 03:30:35,775
...difficult.

37
03:30:35,976 --> 03:30:37,769
They're suspicious and secretive...

38
03:30:38,020 --> 03:30:41,857
...with the worst manners you can
possibly imagine, but they are also brave...

39
03:30:42,107 --> 03:30:43,358
...and kind...

40
03:30:44,943 --> 03:30:46,278
...and loyal to a fault.

41
03:30:47,446 --> 03:30:51,241
I've grown very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.

42
03:30:52,075 --> 03:30:55,621
Now, Thorin values
this stone above all else.

43
03:30:55,871 --> 03:30:59,583
In exchange for its return, I believe
he will give you what you are owed.

44
03:30:59,833 --> 03:31:01,960
There will be no need for war.

45
03:31:08,191 --> 03:31:10,930
GANDALF: Rest up tonight.
You must leave on the morrow.

46
03:31:11,137 --> 03:31:13,184
- Wha...?
- Get as far away from here as possible.

47
03:31:13,317 --> 03:31:14,563
- I--I'm not leaving.

48
03:31:14,696 --> 03:31:17,559
You picked me as the 14th man. I'm
not about to leave the Company now.

49
03:31:17,730 --> 03:31:19,766
- There is no Company. Not anymore.

50
03:31:19,923 --> 03:31:22,902
And I don't like to think what Thorin will
do when he finds out what you've done.

51
03:31:23,103 --> 03:31:24,358
- I'm not afraid of Thorin.

52
03:31:24,608 --> 03:31:25,901
Well, you should be.

53
03:31:26,485 --> 03:31:29,655
Don't underestimate the evil of gold.

54
03:31:29,905 --> 03:31:33,242
Gold over which a serpent has long brooded.

55
03:31:33,492 --> 03:31:37,955
Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts
of all who come near this Mountain.

56
03:31:39,581 --> 03:31:41,426
Almost all. Heh.
