1
02:56:49,624 --> 02:56:54,546
You think you can deceive me,
Barrel-rider?

2
02:56:56,380 --> 02:56:59,383
You have come from Lake-town.

3
02:57:01,093 --> 02:57:05,890
This is some sordid scheme
hatched between these filthy Dwarves...

4
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:09,310
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

5
02:57:10,311 --> 02:57:12,229
<i>Those sniveling cowards...</i>

6
02:57:12,480 --> 02:57:17,026
<i>...with their long bows and Black Arrows.</i>

7
02:57:17,401 --> 02:57:21,405
Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit.

8
02:57:21,948 --> 02:57:23,199
Oh, no.

9
02:57:25,076 --> 02:57:26,535
This isn't their fault!

10
02:57:26,786 --> 02:57:29,413
Wait!
You cannot go to Lake-town!

11
02:57:31,332 --> 02:57:35,461
You care about them, do you?

12
02:57:35,711 --> 02:57:36,771
Good.

13
02:57:37,380 --> 02:57:39,799
Then you can watch them die.
