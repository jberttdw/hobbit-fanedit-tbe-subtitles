1
03:19:31,118 --> 03:19:33,578
...why should I honor such terms?

2
03:19:35,747 --> 03:19:37,707
Because you gave us your word.

3
03:19:41,962 --> 03:19:44,131
Does that mean nothing?

4
03:19:58,687 --> 03:19:59,855
Be gone!

5
03:20:00,730 --> 03:20:02,983
Ere our arrows fly!

[GRUNTS]

7
03:20:21,001 --> 03:20:22,294
BILBO:
What are you doing?

8
03:20:23,837 --> 03:20:26,506
You cannot go to war.

9
03:20:27,674 --> 03:20:29,968
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...

10
03:20:30,218 --> 03:20:33,680
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.

11
03:20:33,930 --> 03:20:36,725
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

12
03:20:37,601 --> 03:20:39,060
We are, in fact, outnumbered.

13
03:20:41,730 --> 03:20:42,939
Not for much longer.

14
03:20:44,733 --> 03:20:45,734
What does that mean?

15
03:20:45,984 --> 03:20:47,736
It means, Master Baggins...

16
03:20:50,780 --> 03:20:53,116
...you should never underestimate Dwarves.

17
03:20:56,828 --> 03:20:58,622
We have reclaimed Erebor.

18
03:20:59,873 --> 03:21:01,124
Now...

19
03:21:01,374 --> 03:21:02,959
...we defend it.

20
03:21:20,810 --> 03:21:22,646
He will give us nothing.

21
03:21:24,064 --> 03:21:25,273
Such a pity.

22
03:21:25,523 --> 03:21:28,902
- Still, you tried.
- I do not understand.

23
03:21:30,111 --> 03:21:31,196
Why?

24
03:21:31,947 --> 03:21:33,448
Why would he risk war?

[GRUNTING]

26
03:21:46,878 --> 03:21:49,172
It is fruitless to reason with them.

27
03:21:49,422 --> 03:21:52,008
They understand only one thing.

28
03:21:55,971 --> 03:21:57,180
We attack at dawn.

29
03:22:00,392 --> 03:22:01,893
Are you with us?

30
03:22:33,675 --> 03:22:34,301
Aye.

31
03:22:38,555 --> 03:22:40,974
THORIN:
Master Baggins, come here.

32
03:22:58,199 --> 03:22:59,909
You're going to need this.

33
03:23:01,411 --> 03:23:02,662
Put it on.

34
03:23:07,667 --> 03:23:10,420
This vest is made of silver steel.

35
03:23:12,922 --> 03:23:16,718
"Mithril", it was called by my forebears.

36
03:23:19,846 --> 03:23:21,931
No blade can pierce it.

37
03:23:33,234 --> 03:23:34,235
I look absurd.

38
03:23:34,486 --> 03:23:36,488
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.

39
03:23:36,738 --> 03:23:38,198
It is a gift.

40
03:23:39,741 --> 03:23:41,284
A token of our friendship.

41
03:23:44,662 --> 03:23:47,040
True friends are hard to come by.

42
03:23:48,708 --> 03:23:50,377
I have been blind...

43
03:23:50,627 --> 03:23:52,504
...but now I begin to see.

44
03:23:53,880 --> 03:23:55,382
I am betrayed.

45
03:23:56,716 --> 03:23:58,093
Betrayed?

46
03:23:58,635 --> 03:24:00,470
The Arkenstone.

47
03:24:09,938 --> 03:24:11,439
One of them has taken it.

48
03:24:18,696 --> 03:24:21,574
One of them is false.

49
03:24:22,617 --> 03:24:23,785
Thorin...

50
03:24:24,619 --> 03:24:29,249
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain. Is that not enough?

51
03:24:29,499 --> 03:24:32,001
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...

52
03:24:32,669 --> 03:24:36,339
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.

53
03:24:36,589 --> 03:24:40,593
Now, is this treasure
truly worth more than your honor?

54
03:24:40,844 --> 03:24:43,263
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.

55
03:24:43,930 --> 03:24:45,765
For that, I am grateful.

56
03:24:46,015 --> 03:24:49,602
It was nobly done, but the treasure
in this mountain does not belong...

57
03:24:49,946 --> 03:24:51,271
...to the people of Lake-town.

58
03:24:51,521 --> 03:24:52,439
This gold...

59
03:24:56,568 --> 03:24:58,111
...is ours.

60
03:25:01,281 --> 03:25:02,532
And ours alone.

61
03:25:06,035 --> 03:25:07,620
By my life...

62
03:25:08,538 --> 03:25:11,458
...I will not part...

63
03:25:12,208 --> 03:25:15,503
...with a single coin.

64
03:25:17,172 --> 03:25:18,798
Not...

65
03:25:19,799 --> 03:25:21,301
...one...

66
03:25:21,885 --> 03:25:23,887
...piece of it.
