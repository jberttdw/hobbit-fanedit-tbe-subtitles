1
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,426
It began...

2
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:57,877
Well, it began as you might expect.

3
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,682
In a hole in the ground...

4
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:04,425
...there lived a Hobbit.

5
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:11,775
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.

6
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:14,111
This was a Hobbit hole.

7
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:19,607
And that means good food, a warm hearth...

8
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,777
...and all the comforts of home.
