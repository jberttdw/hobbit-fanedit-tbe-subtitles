1
03:59:52,259 --> 03:59:53,509
It's Thorin.

2
03:59:54,011 --> 03:59:55,261
And Fili, Kili...

3
03:59:55,679 --> 03:59:57,055
...and Dwalin.

4
03:59:57,963 --> 04:00:00,100
He's taking his best warriors.

5
04:00:00,350 --> 04:00:01,600
To do what?

6
04:00:02,436 --> 04:00:04,813
To cut the head off the snake.

7
04:00:25,959 --> 04:00:26,768
[YELLS]

8
04:00:38,597 --> 04:00:39,347
Die!

9
04:00:46,605 --> 04:00:47,981
Gandalf!

10
04:00:48,690 --> 04:00:49,940
Legolas.

11
04:00:51,172 --> 04:00:52,694
Legolas Greenleaf!

12
04:00:52,944 --> 04:00:54,203
There is a second army.

13
04:00:54,404 --> 04:00:57,365
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.

14
04:00:57,616 --> 04:00:59,076
Gundabad.

15
04:01:00,285 --> 04:01:01,953
This was their plan all along.

16
04:01:04,293 --> 04:01:08,126
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.

17
04:01:08,376 --> 04:01:09,753
Wha--The North?

18
04:01:10,003 --> 04:01:11,455
Where is the North, exactly?

19
04:01:11,588 --> 04:01:13,673
Ravenhill.

20
04:01:14,883 --> 04:01:17,386
Ravenhill?
Thorin is up there.

21
04:01:17,614 --> 04:01:20,097
And Fili and Kili. They're all up there.
