They may not be the best fit,

The last time we saw such a weapon...

7
02:27:04,116 --> 02:27:05,619
...a city was on fire.

<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

13
02:27:23,552 --> 02:27:25,304
But a dragon's hide is tough.

14
02:27:25,887 --> 02:27:28,056
Tougher than the strongest armor.

15
02:27:28,307 --> 02:27:31,476
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

16
02:27:31,727 --> 02:27:33,312
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

17
02:27:34,271 --> 02:27:37,357

He loosened a scale under the left wing.
