They may not be the best fit,
but they'll keep you warm.

2
02:26:41,531 --> 02:26:42,711
Thank you very much.

3
02:26:52,938 --> 02:26:55,023
A Dwarvish windlance.

4
02:26:55,978 --> 02:26:57,558
You look like you've seen a ghost.

5
02:26:58,193 --> 02:26:59,361
He has.

6
02:27:00,153 --> 02:27:03,073
The last time we saw such a weapon...

7
02:27:04,116 --> 02:27:05,889
...a city was on fire.

8
02:27:07,035 --> 02:27:09,288
It was the day the dragon came.

[PEOPLE SCREAMING]

10
02:27:12,541 --> 02:27:15,377
<i>The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.</i>

11
02:27:17,838 --> 02:27:20,048
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

12
02:27:20,299 --> 02:27:22,426
<i>...rallied his bowmen
to fire upon the beast.</i>

13
02:27:23,552 --> 02:27:25,304
But a dragon's hide is tough.

14
02:27:25,887 --> 02:27:28,056
Tougher than the strongest armor.

15
02:27:28,307 --> 02:27:31,476
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

16
02:27:31,727 --> 02:27:33,694
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

17
02:27:34,271 --> 02:27:37,357
<i>And few of those arrows were ever made.</i>

18
02:27:42,696 --> 02:27:46,622
<i>The store was running low
when Girion made his last stand.</i>

19
02:27:54,124 --> 02:27:57,544
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

20
02:27:58,128 --> 02:27:59,963
...much would have been different.

21
02:28:04,092 --> 02:28:06,011
You speak as if you were there.

22
02:28:07,387 --> 02:28:09,473
All Dwarves know the tale.

23
02:28:09,806 --> 02:28:12,017
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

24
02:28:12,267 --> 02:28:14,144
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

25
02:28:14,394 --> 02:28:16,532
One more shot and he
would have killed the beast.

[DWALIN CHUCKLES]
That's a fairy story, lad.

27
02:28:19,733 --> 02:28:21,109
Nothing more.

28
02:28:22,110 --> 02:28:23,487
You took our money.

29
02:28:24,571 --> 02:28:25,864
Where are the weapons?
