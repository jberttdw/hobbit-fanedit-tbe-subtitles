1
01:11:26,076 --> 01:11:28,411
Where's Bilbo? Where's the Hobbit?

2
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:29,704
[BILBO GRUNTING]

3
01:11:29,913 --> 01:11:31,205
There!

4
01:11:34,168 --> 01:11:35,585
THORIN:
Get him!

5
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,462
Aah!

6
01:11:37,671 --> 01:11:39,964
- Grab my hand!
- Bilbo!

7
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,760
DORI: Ori, be careful!
ORI: Take it!

8
01:11:43,927 --> 01:11:46,429
DWALIN: I've got you, lad.
ORI: Grab on! Grab on!

9
01:11:55,272 --> 01:11:56,439
[GRUNTING]

10
01:11:56,607 --> 01:11:59,442
Come on. Get him.

11
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,277
GLOIN:
Come on, lad. Up you get.

12
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:06,866
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

13
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:09,911
He's been lost ever since he left home.

14
01:12:10,746 --> 01:12:12,622
He should never have come.

15
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:14,707
He has no place amongst us.

16
01:12:16,627 --> 01:12:18,336
Dwalin!

17
01:12:24,343 --> 01:12:26,886
DWALIN: lt looks safe enough.
THORIN: Search to the back.

18
01:12:27,346 --> 01:12:30,139
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

19
01:12:33,644 --> 01:12:35,603
DWALIN:
There's nothing here.

20
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:39,565
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

21
01:12:39,733 --> 01:12:42,652
No. No fires. Not in this place.

22
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,529
Get some sleep.

23
01:12:44,696 --> 01:12:47,198
We start at first light.

24
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:51,077
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

25
01:12:51,245 --> 01:12:54,205
- That was the plan.
- Plans change.

26
01:12:54,373 --> 01:12:57,875
Bofur, take the first watch.
