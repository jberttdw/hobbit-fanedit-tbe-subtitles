1
02:43:02,311 --> 02:43:05,856
You want me to find a jewel?

2
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:09,110
A large, white jewel.

3
02:43:09,568 --> 02:43:10,694
Yes.

4
02:43:12,071 --> 02:43:14,657
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

5
02:43:14,990 --> 02:43:18,202
There is only one Arkenstone...

6
02:43:18,953 --> 02:43:21,038
...and you'll know it when you see it.

7
02:43:22,164 --> 02:43:23,290
Right.

8
02:43:27,044 --> 02:43:28,754
In truth, lad...

9
02:43:29,547 --> 02:43:31,590
I do not know...

10
02:43:31,841 --> 02:43:33,926
...what you will find down there.

11
02:43:36,053 --> 02:43:39,181
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

12
02:43:39,431 --> 02:43:40,391
No, Balin.

13
02:43:41,642 --> 02:43:43,686
I promised I would do this...

14
02:43:44,353 --> 02:43:46,063
...and I think I must try.

15
02:43:47,731 --> 02:43:49,275
[CHUCKLES]

16
02:43:50,776 --> 02:43:52,486
It never ceases to amaze me.

17
02:43:52,736 --> 02:43:53,529
What's that?

18
02:43:53,779 --> 02:43:55,489
The courage of Hobbits.

19
02:43:57,867 --> 02:43:59,118
Go now...

20
02:43:59,618 --> 02:44:03,622
...with as much luck as you can muster.

21
02:44:10,838 --> 02:44:12,131
Oh, Bilbo?

22
02:44:14,550 --> 02:44:16,844
If there is, in fact...

23
02:44:18,345 --> 02:44:20,472
...a live dragon down there?

24
02:44:23,517 --> 02:44:24,935
Don't waken it.
