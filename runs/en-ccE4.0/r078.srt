1
02:55:53,245 --> 02:55:54,329
What about Bilbo?

2
02:55:54,580 --> 02:55:55,581
Give him more time.

3
02:55:55,831 --> 02:55:58,000
Time to do what? To be killed?

4
02:56:00,460 --> 02:56:01,712
You're afraid.

5
02:56:03,380 --> 02:56:05,674
Yes, I'm afraid.

6
02:56:06,842 --> 02:56:08,177
I fear for you.

7
02:56:09,553 --> 02:56:11,722
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

8
02:56:12,139 --> 02:56:14,474
A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.

9
02:56:14,725 --> 02:56:16,310
I am not my grandfather.

10
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:18,312
- You're not yourself.

11
02:56:19,188 --> 02:56:21,315
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there--

12
02:56:21,565 --> 02:56:26,195
THORIN: I will not risk this
quest for the life of one burglar.

13
02:56:28,071 --> 02:56:29,490
Bilbo.

14
02:56:29,865 --> 02:56:31,783
His name is Bilbo.
