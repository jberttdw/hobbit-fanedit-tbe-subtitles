1
01:53:58,847 --> 01:54:00,641
Now there is only one.

2
01:54:03,269 --> 01:54:08,315
You need to reach the mountain
before the last days of autumn.

3
01:54:08,566 --> 01:54:10,901
Before Durin's Day falls, yes.

4
01:54:11,443 --> 01:54:12,987
You are running out of time.

5
01:54:13,237 --> 01:54:15,447
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

6
01:54:15,698 --> 01:54:18,492
A darkness lies upon that forest.

7
01:54:18,742 --> 01:54:21,745
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

8
01:54:22,830 --> 01:54:25,583
There is an alliance
between the Orcs of Moria...

9
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:28,711
...and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.

10
01:54:28,961 --> 01:54:33,173
I would not venture there,
except in great need.

11
01:54:33,424 --> 01:54:36,427
We will take the Elven Road.
That path is still safe.

12
01:54:36,677 --> 01:54:37,636
BEORN:
"Safe"?

13
01:54:38,095 --> 01:54:40,639
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood
are not like their kin.

14
01:54:41,265 --> 01:54:44,852
They're less wise and more dangerous.

15
01:54:46,312 --> 01:54:47,897
But it matters not.

16
01:54:49,815 --> 01:54:50,900
What do you mean?

17
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:53,902
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

18
01:54:54,653 --> 01:54:57,364
Their numbers are growing.

19
01:54:57,615 --> 01:54:59,074
And you are on foot.

20
01:54:59,992 --> 01:55:03,245
You will never reach the forest alive.

21
01:55:07,708 --> 01:55:10,044
I don't like Dwarves.

22
01:55:11,045 --> 01:55:12,713
They're greedy--

23
01:55:13,422 --> 01:55:14,423
...and blind.

24
01:55:15,425 --> 01:55:20,012
Blind to the lives of those
they deem lesser than their own.

25
01:55:27,144 --> 01:55:29,396
But Orcs I hate more.

26
01:55:31,231 --> 01:55:32,900
What do you need?

27
01:55:38,197 --> 01:55:40,991
BEORN:
Go now. While you have the light.
