They could not have moved in daylight.

2
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:41,857
There must be a cave nearby.

[INSECTS BUZZING]

4
00:52:52,494 --> 00:52:54,787
NORI:
Oh, what's that stench?

5
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:58,123
GANDALF:
It's a Troll-hoard.

6
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,085
Be careful what you touch.

00:53:01,253 --> 00:53:03,254
[DWARVES COUGHING]

8
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,600
Seems a shame
just to leave it lying around.

9
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:20,646
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.

10
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:22,481
- Nori.
NORI: Yeah?

11
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:24,024
Get a shovel.

12
00:53:41,293 --> 00:53:43,335
These swords were not made by any Troll.

13
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:53,596
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.

14
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:04,023
These were forged in Gondolin,
by the High Elves of the First Age.

15
00:54:04,524 --> 00:54:06,734
You could not wish for a finer blade!

16
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:22,541
BOFUR: Set it down.
GLOIN: That's good.

17
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:25,169
BOFUR:
All right, come on. Quick.

18
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:36,180
We're making a long-term deposit.

19
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,390
THORIN:
Let's get out of this foul place.

20
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,517
Come on, let's go.

21
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:42,645
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

22
00:55:02,123 --> 00:55:03,874
GANDALF: Bilbo.
BILBO: Hmm?

23
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,377
Here.

24
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:09,088
This is about your size.

25
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,136
I can't take this.

26
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,514
The blade is of Elvish make...

27
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:23,644
...which means it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

28
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:27,147
I have never used a sword in my life.

29
00:55:27,315 --> 00:55:29,316
And I hope you never have to.

30
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:31,902
But if you do, remember this:

31
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:38,617
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

32
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:41,495
...but when to spare one.
