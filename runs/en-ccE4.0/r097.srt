03:07:32,683 --> 03:07:35,978
THORIN:
It is here in these halls. I know it.

2
03:07:36,229 --> 03:07:38,022
DWALIN:
We have searched and searched.

3
03:07:38,223 --> 03:07:39,285
THORIN:
Not well enough.

4
03:07:39,486 --> 03:07:42,314
DWALIN: Thorin...
We all would see the stone returned.

5
03:07:42,515 --> 03:07:44,987
THORIN:
And yet, it is still not found!

6
03:07:47,824 --> 03:07:51,744
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?

7
03:08:00,545 --> 03:08:02,296
The Arkenstone...

8
03:08:03,214 --> 03:08:05,341
...is the birthright of our people.

9
03:08:06,092 --> 03:08:09,011
THORIN:
It is The King's Jewel.

10
03:08:10,388 --> 03:08:11,889
Am I not the king?

11
03:08:23,234 --> 03:08:24,735
Know this:

12
03:08:28,197 --> 03:08:30,449
If anyone should find it...

13
03:08:31,284 --> 03:08:33,286
...and withhold it from me...

14
03:08:35,121 --> 03:08:36,998
...I will be avenged.

15
03:08:46,340 --> 03:08:48,342
[SIGHING]

16
03:08:52,597 --> 03:08:54,140
Dragon-sickness.

17
03:08:55,641 --> 03:08:57,310
I've seen it before.

18
03:08:59,145 --> 03:09:00,563
That look.

19
03:09:01,063 --> 03:09:02,773
The terrible need.

20
03:09:04,108 --> 03:09:07,236
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.

21
03:09:10,114 --> 03:09:11,949
It sent his grandfather mad.

22
03:09:13,701 --> 03:09:15,578
Balin, if Thorin...

23
03:09:16,662 --> 03:09:18,414
...had the Arkenstone...

24
03:09:19,707 --> 03:09:21,626
...or if it was found...

25
03:09:24,211 --> 03:09:25,713
...would it help?

26
03:09:28,341 --> 03:09:32,053
That stone crowns all.

27
03:09:33,220 --> 03:09:36,098
It is the summit of this great wealth...

28
03:09:36,349 --> 03:09:39,602
...bestowing power upon he who bears it.

29
03:09:39,852 --> 03:09:41,771
Would it stay his madness?

30
03:09:43,439 --> 03:09:44,732
No, laddie.

31
03:09:46,901 --> 03:09:48,611
I fear it would make him worse.

32
03:09:51,447 --> 03:09:53,157
Perhaps it is best...

33
03:09:54,283 --> 03:09:55,952
...it remains lost.

34
03:10:09,757 --> 03:10:11,050
THORIN:
What is that?

35
03:10:12,510 --> 03:10:14,053
In your hand.

36
03:10:14,254 --> 03:10:15,504
It's--It's nothing.

37
03:10:15,705 --> 03:10:16,956
Show me.

38
03:10:18,516 --> 03:10:19,809
It...

39
03:10:26,774 --> 03:10:29,318
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

40
03:10:33,322 --> 03:10:35,157
You've carried it all this way?

41
03:10:35,408 --> 03:10:37,201
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.

42
03:10:37,451 --> 03:10:39,036
In Bag End.

43
03:10:41,706 --> 03:10:44,834
It's a poor prize to take back to the Shire.

44
03:10:46,669 --> 03:10:48,004
One day, it'll grow.

45
03:10:49,797 --> 03:10:52,091
And every time I look at it, I'll remember.

46
03:10:53,467 --> 03:10:56,137
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...

47
03:10:57,221 --> 03:10:59,348
...and how lucky I am that I made it home.

48
03:11:08,607 --> 03:11:10,192
Thorin, I...

49
03:11:10,443 --> 03:11:11,694
DWALIN:
Thorin.

50
03:11:11,944 --> 03:11:14,030
Survivors from Lake-town...

51
03:11:14,572 --> 03:11:16,449
...they're streaming into Dale.

52
03:11:17,867 --> 03:11:19,577
There's hundreds of them.

53
03:11:21,245 --> 03:11:23,205
Call everyone to the gate.

54
03:11:24,457 --> 03:11:26,876
To the gate! Now!

55
03:11:28,210 --> 03:11:29,628

03:11:57,907 --> 03:12:00,493
BARD:
Come on. Keep moving.
