03:47:33,553 --> 03:47:35,388
Fall back!

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

03:48:04,041 --> 03:48:07,295
DWALIN:
Since when do we forsake our own people?

5
03:48:07,846 --> 03:48:09,096
Thorin...

6
03:48:09,297 --> 03:48:11,416
They are dying out there.

7
03:48:17,054 --> 03:48:20,308
There are halls beneath
halls within this Mountain.

8
03:48:22,435 --> 03:48:24,562
Places we can fortify...

9
03:48:25,855 --> 03:48:28,900
...shore up, make safe, yes.

10
03:48:30,568 --> 03:48:31,569
Yes...

11
03:48:32,778 --> 03:48:34,028
...that is it.

12
03:48:34,739 --> 03:48:37,530
We must move the gold
further underground to safety.

13
03:48:37,730 --> 03:48:40,774
- Did you not hear me?
Dain is surrounded.

14
03:48:40,974 --> 03:48:42,684
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

15
03:48:45,249 --> 03:48:46,709
Many die in war.

16
03:48:47,960 --> 03:48:49,545
Life is cheap.

17
03:48:51,672 --> 03:48:53,703
But a treasure such as this...

18
03:48:54,374 --> 03:48:56,802
...cannot be counted in lives lost.

19
03:48:59,889 --> 03:49:01,390
It is worth...

20
03:49:01,641 --> 03:49:04,143
...all the blood we can spend.

21
03:49:05,811 --> 03:49:08,231
You sit here in these vast halls...

22
03:49:08,481 --> 03:49:10,942
...with a crown upon your head...

23
03:49:11,692 --> 03:49:14,779
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

24
03:49:16,614 --> 03:49:18,533
Do not speak to me...

25
03:49:20,201 --> 03:49:22,548
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...

26
03:49:24,121 --> 03:49:27,792

- <i>I am your king!</i>
- You were always my king.

30
03:49:39,887 --> 03:49:41,764
You used to know that once.

31
03:49:43,099 --> 03:49:45,685
You cannot see what you have become.

32
03:49:49,146 --> 03:49:50,356
Go.

33
03:49:53,109 --> 03:49:54,402
Get out.
