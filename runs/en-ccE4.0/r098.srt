1
03:12:04,876 --> 03:12:06,126
BOFUR:
Up it goes!

2
03:12:09,238 --> 03:12:10,488
DWALIN:
That's it.

3
03:12:13,993 --> 03:12:16,203
I want this fortress made safe by sunup.

4
03:12:17,079 --> 03:12:18,622
This Mountain was hard-won.

5
03:12:18,873 --> 03:12:20,791
I will not see it taken again.

6
03:12:21,041 --> 03:12:23,169
The people of Lake-town have nothing.

7
03:12:23,419 --> 03:12:24,795
They came to us in need.

8
03:12:25,045 --> 03:12:27,506
They have lost everything.

9
03:12:27,757 --> 03:12:30,885
Do not tell me what they have lost.

10
03:12:31,761 --> 03:12:34,180
I know well enough their hardship.

11
03:12:35,598 --> 03:12:39,268
Those who have lived through
dragon fire should rejoice!

12
03:12:40,603 --> 03:12:43,022
They have much
to be grateful for.

13
03:12:48,334 --> 03:12:49,589
More stone.

14
03:12:52,364 --> 03:12:54,492
Bring more stone to the gate!

15
03:12:54,742 --> 03:12:55,992
DWALIN:
That's it.
