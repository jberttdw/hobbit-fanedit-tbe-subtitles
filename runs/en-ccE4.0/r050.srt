1
01:49:30,615 --> 01:49:32,857
Ah, Bilbo.
There you are.

2
01:49:33,135 --> 01:49:36,985
Now, this will require some delicate handling.

3
01:49:37,215 --> 01:49:39,263
We must tread very carefully.

4
01:49:39,495 --> 01:49:43,500
The last person to have startled him
was torn to shreds.

5
01:49:45,815 --> 01:49:48,135
I will go first and uh, Bilbo?

6
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:50,104
You come with me.

7
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:54,143
- Is this a good idea?
GANDALF: Yes.

8
01:49:54,215 --> 01:49:56,502
Now, the rest of you, you just wait here...

9
01:49:56,735 --> 01:49:59,306
...and don't come out until I give the signal.
BOFUR: Right.

10
01:49:59,535 --> 01:50:00,775
Wait for the signal.

11
01:50:01,015 --> 01:50:04,337
And no sudden moves or loud noises,
and don't overcrowd him.

12
01:50:04,575 --> 01:50:06,896
And only come out in pairs. Right.

13
01:50:07,175 --> 01:50:09,248
No, actually, Bombur...

14
01:50:10,255 --> 01:50:12,337
...um, you count as two
so you should come out alone.

15
01:50:12,575 --> 01:50:13,622
Mm.

16
01:50:14,815 --> 01:50:17,421
Remember, wait for the signal.

17
01:50:17,655 --> 01:50:20,340
BOFUR:
The signal. Right.

18
01:50:20,575 --> 01:50:21,615
What signal would that be?

19
01:50:37,655 --> 01:50:40,032
GANDALF: Ahem.
- You're nervous.

20
01:50:43,175 --> 01:50:46,384
Nervous? What nonsense.

21
01:50:46,855 --> 01:50:48,266
Good morning.

22
01:50:54,375 --> 01:50:56,184
Good morning!

23
01:50:59,015 --> 01:51:00,460
BEORN:
Who are you?

24
01:51:00,695 --> 01:51:04,495
I'm Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

25
01:51:09,335 --> 01:51:11,224
Never heard of him.

26
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:15,898
I'm a Wizard.

27
01:51:15,975 --> 01:51:18,782
Perhaps you've heard of
my colleague Radagast the Brown.

28
01:51:18,895 --> 01:51:21,899
He resides in the southern
borders of Mirkwood.

29
01:51:22,299 --> 01:51:24,427
What do you want?

30
01:51:24,495 --> 01:51:28,056
Well, simply to thank you
for your hospitality.

31
01:51:28,335 --> 01:51:30,156
You may have noticed that we took refuge...

32
01:51:30,215 --> 01:51:32,789
...in your lodgings here last night.

33
01:51:33,655 --> 01:51:35,815
Who is this little fellow?

34
01:51:35,895 --> 01:51:39,382
Well, this would be
Mr. Baggins from the Shire.

35
01:51:41,455 --> 01:51:44,048
He's not a Dwarf, is he?

36
01:51:44,255 --> 01:51:47,733
Why, no. No, he's a Hobbit.

37
01:51:47,735 --> 01:51:51,296
A good family
and unimpeachable reputation.

38
01:51:51,535 --> 01:51:54,937
A Halfling and a Wizard.

39
01:51:56,093 --> 01:51:57,333
How come you here?

40
01:51:57,335 --> 01:52:00,496
GANDALF: Oh, well, the fact is
that we've had a bad time of it...

41
01:52:00,735 --> 01:52:03,579
...from Goblins in the mountains.

42
01:52:03,692 --> 01:52:05,418
What did you go near Goblins for?

43
01:52:05,455 --> 01:52:06,945
Stupid thing to do.

44
01:52:07,215 --> 01:52:08,421
You are absolutely right...

45
01:52:08,655 --> 01:52:09,736
- There it is. Go. Go.

46
01:52:09,975 --> 01:52:12,262
GANDALF:
It was terrible.

47
01:52:21,809 --> 01:52:23,776
DWALIN:
Dwalin, and Balin.

48
01:52:24,017 --> 01:52:26,903
GANDALF:
And I, uh, I must confess that,  uh...

49
01:52:27,135 --> 01:52:30,659
...several of our group are, in fact, Dwarves.

50
01:52:30,695 --> 01:52:35,536
Do you call two...
"several"?

51
01:52:35,775 --> 01:52:38,346
Well, uh, now you put it that way...

52
01:52:38,615 --> 01:52:40,344
[STUTTERING]

53
01:52:40,815 --> 01:52:43,142
Yes, there could be more than two.

54
01:52:43,895 --> 01:52:44,984
BOFUR:
Go, go.

55
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:46,550
GLOIN:
Wait, that's us.

56
01:52:49,895 --> 01:52:52,779
GANDALF: Oh, and here are some more
of our, uh, happy troop.

57
01:52:53,015 --> 01:52:55,222
And do you call six a "troop"?

58
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:56,293
[LAUGHS]

59
01:52:56,295 --> 01:52:58,696
What are you, a traveling circus?

60
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:01,856
BOFUR:
Go. Go. Go, go.

61
01:53:05,135 --> 01:53:09,178
Dori and Ori at your service.

62
01:53:09,264 --> 01:53:10,892
BEORN:
I don't want your service.

63
01:53:11,002 --> 01:53:12,559
Absolutely understandable.

64
01:53:12,794 --> 01:53:14,102
Go. Go.

65
01:53:16,735 --> 01:53:20,063
Oh, Fili and Kili. I'd quite forgotten. Yes.

66
01:53:20,635 --> 01:53:24,844
Oh, yes, and uh, Nori, Bofur,
Bifur...

67
01:53:26,495 --> 01:53:28,145
...and Bombur.

68
01:53:29,295 --> 01:53:30,899
Is that it?

69
01:53:33,695 --> 01:53:35,220
Are there any more?

70
01:53:42,535 --> 01:53:43,582
Ah.

71
01:53:47,495 --> 01:53:51,261
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.
