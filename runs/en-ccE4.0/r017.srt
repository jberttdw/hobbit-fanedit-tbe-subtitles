1
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,836
Not with your companions?

2
01:06:51,837 --> 01:06:56,837
Uh, no, I shan't be missed.

3
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:03,222
The truth is that most of them
don't think I should be on this journey.

4
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:05,933
Indeed?

5
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:09,228
I've heard that Hobbits are very resilient.

6
01:07:12,524 --> 01:07:14,150
Really?

7
01:07:14,151 --> 01:07:19,151
ELROND:
Mm.

8
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:24,740
I've also heard they're
fond of the comforts of home.

9
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:30,583
I've heard that it's unwise
to seek the council of Elves.

10
01:07:30,584 --> 01:07:35,584
That they will answer with yes and no.

11
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:40,277
[LAUGHS]

12
01:07:42,304 --> 01:07:47,304
You are very welcome to stay here,
if that is your wish.
