1
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:24,885
GLOIN: Again!
BALIN: Leave it!

2
02:12:25,115 --> 02:12:26,533
There's no way out!

3
02:12:26,783 --> 02:12:28,785
This is no Orc dungeon.

4
02:12:29,036 --> 02:12:31,538
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

5
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:35,626
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

6
02:12:40,297 --> 02:12:43,842
THRANDUIL: Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

7
02:12:44,509 --> 02:12:49,348
A quest to reclaim a homeland,
and slay a dragon.

8
02:12:50,724 --> 02:12:54,728
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

9
02:12:55,604 --> 02:12:57,272
Attempted burglary.

10
02:12:58,023 --> 02:13:00,275
Or something of that ilk.

11
02:13:03,445 --> 02:13:05,447
You have found a way in.

12
02:13:05,697 --> 02:13:09,910
You seek that which would
bestow upon you the right to rule.

13
02:13:10,577 --> 02:13:12,454
The King's Jewel.

14
02:13:13,372 --> 02:13:14,873
The Arkenstone.

15
02:13:17,125 --> 02:13:20,462
It is precious to you beyond measure.

16
02:13:21,463 --> 02:13:23,173
I understand that.

17
02:13:24,132 --> 02:13:27,761
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

18
02:13:29,096 --> 02:13:32,391
White gems
of pure starlight.

19
02:13:33,433 --> 02:13:35,685
I offer you my help.

20
02:13:38,897 --> 02:13:40,273
I am listening.

21
02:13:40,524 --> 02:13:42,150
I will let you go...

22
02:13:43,151 --> 02:13:45,821
...if you but return what is mine.

23
02:13:49,032 --> 02:13:51,729
THORIN: A favor for a favor.
THRANDUIL: You have my word.

24
02:13:52,953 --> 02:13:55,455
One king to another.

25
02:13:59,626 --> 02:14:02,838
I would not trust Thranduil...

26
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:06,258
...the great king, to honor his word...

27
02:14:06,508 --> 02:14:09,010
...should the end of all days
be upon us!

28
02:14:09,636 --> 02:14:12,931
You, who lack all honor.

29
02:14:14,015 --> 02:14:16,059
I have seen how you treat your friends.

30
02:14:16,726 --> 02:14:20,355
We came to you once, starving, homeless...

31
02:14:20,605 --> 02:14:22,065
...seeking your help.

32
02:14:22,607 --> 02:14:24,985
But you turned your back!

33
02:14:25,277 --> 02:14:28,905
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

34
02:14:29,156 --> 02:14:31,116
...and the inferno that destroyed us.

35
02:14:31,363 --> 02:14:33,581
[SPEAKS IN DWARVISH]

36
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:35,829
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

37
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:39,374
I know its wrath and ruin.

38
02:14:41,168 --> 02:14:42,586
[INHALES]

39
02:14:43,545 --> 02:14:47,758
I have faced the great serpents of the North.

40
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:54,139
I warned your grandfather of
what his greed would summon.

41
02:14:55,682 --> 02:14:57,601
But he would not listen.

42
02:15:02,189 --> 02:15:04,232
You are just like him.

43
02:15:06,693 --> 02:15:10,238
Stay here if you will, and rot.

44
02:15:10,489 --> 02:15:14,659
A hundred years is a mere
blink in the life of an Elf.

45
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:16,578
I'm patient.

46
02:15:17,621 --> 02:15:19,623
I can wait.

47
02:15:27,088 --> 02:15:29,591
- Did he offer you a deal?
- He did.

48
02:15:31,301 --> 02:15:34,919
I told him he could go
<i>ish kakhfé ai-'d dEIr-rugnu!</i>

49
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:36,988
Him and all his kin!

50
02:15:38,266 --> 02:15:40,018
Well, that's that, then.

51
02:15:41,728 --> 02:15:44,231
A deal was our only hope.
