1
04:01:41,282 --> 04:01:42,826
Recall your company.

2
04:01:44,119 --> 04:01:45,995
[HORN BLOWING]

3
04:01:48,957 --> 04:01:51,937
My lord, dispatch this force to Ravenhill.

4
04:01:52,226 --> 04:01:54,963
The Dwarves are about to be
overrun. Thorin must be warned.

5
04:01:55,213 --> 04:01:57,016
By all means, warn him.

6
04:01:57,452 --> 04:02:01,720
I have spent enough Elvish blood in
defense of this accursed land. No more.

7
04:02:01,970 --> 04:02:03,430
Thranduil?

8
04:02:04,431 --> 04:02:05,194
I'll go.

9
04:02:06,307 --> 04:02:07,392
Don't be ridiculous.

10
04:02:07,642 --> 04:02:09,978
- You'll never make it.
- Why not?

11
04:02:10,854 --> 04:02:13,398
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.

12
04:02:14,274 --> 04:02:15,608
No, they won't.

13
04:02:17,152 --> 04:02:18,152
They won't see me.

14
04:02:19,487 --> 04:02:21,156
It's out of the question.

15
04:02:22,157 --> 04:02:23,158
I won't allow it.

16
04:02:24,159 --> 04:02:26,578
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.
