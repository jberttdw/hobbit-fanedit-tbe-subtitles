1
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:16,483
GREAT GOBLIN [SINGING]:
Bones will be shattered

2
01:19:16,645 --> 01:19:17,812
Necks will be wrung

3
01:19:17,979 --> 01:19:19,980
You'll be beaten and battered

4
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:21,565
From racks you'll be hung

5
01:19:21,733 --> 01:19:26,028
You will die down here
And never be found

6
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:30,282
Down in the deep of Goblin-town

7
01:19:33,203 --> 01:19:37,164
I know that sword!
It is the Goblin-cleaver!

8
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:39,083
The Biter!

9
01:19:39,543 --> 01:19:42,795
The blade that sliced a thousand necks!

10
01:19:42,963 --> 01:19:46,882
Slash them! Beat them! Kill them!

11
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,759
Kill them all!
