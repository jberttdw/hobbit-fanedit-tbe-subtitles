02:15:48,074 --> 02:15:50,785
ELROS: Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

2
02:15:51,369 --> 02:15:54,414
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

3
02:15:54,664 --> 02:15:56,708
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

4
02:15:56,958 --> 02:16:01,630
GALION: Say what you like about our ill-
tempered king. He has excellent taste in wine.

5
02:16:02,631 --> 02:16:04,132
Come, Elros, try it.

6
02:16:04,841 --> 02:16:06,927
ELROS:
I have the Dwarves in my charge.

7
02:16:07,344 --> 02:16:10,263
GALION: They're locked up.
Where can they go? Ha, ha.

8
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:15,894
BOFUR:
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

9
02:16:16,144 --> 02:16:17,854
Must be nearly dawn.

10
02:16:18,104 --> 02:16:20,398
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

11
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,445
Not stuck in here, you're not.

12
02:16:31,409 --> 02:16:33,161
Bilbo!
KILI: What?

13
02:16:33,411 --> 02:16:34,664
[DWARVES CHATTER]

14
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:37,666
Shh! There are guards nearby!

15
02:16:43,734 --> 02:16:46,758
THORIN: Close the doors, it'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

16
02:16:57,560 --> 02:16:59,946
THORIN: Up the stairs.
DWALIN: You first. Ori.

17
02:17:00,146 --> 02:17:01,989
BILBO:
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

18
02:17:02,983 --> 02:17:05,568
- Go.
OIN: Easy, now.

19
02:17:12,701 --> 02:17:14,869
[SNORING]

20
02:17:20,667 --> 02:17:21,924
[WHISPERING]
This way.
