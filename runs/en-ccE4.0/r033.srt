Where's Bilbo?

Where is our Hobbit?!?

Curse the Halfling! Now he's lost?

I thought he was with Dori!

01:39:04,722 --> 01:39:07,766
- Don't blame me!
- Well, where did you last see him?

23
01:39:07,934 --> 01:39:10,644
I think I saw him slip away
when they first collared us.

And what happened, exactly?

- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.

26
01:39:14,857 --> 01:39:17,692
Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.

27
01:39:18,611 --> 01:39:21,613
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...

28
01:39:21,781 --> 01:39:24,157
...since first he stepped out of his door.

29
01:39:24,325 --> 01:39:26,660
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

No. He isn't.

I have never been so glad
to see anyone in my life.

Bilbo. We'd given you up.

did you get past the Goblins?

It matters. I want to know.

01:40:19,005 --> 01:40:20,714
Why did you come back?

41
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:27,137
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

42
01:40:28,681 --> 01:40:31,641
And you're right, I often think of Bag End.

43
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:34,269
I miss my books.

44
01:40:35,021 --> 01:40:37,772
And my armchair and my garden.

See, that's where I belong.

That's home.

47
01:40:44,322 --> 01:40:46,406
And that's why I came back. Because...

48
01:40:48,743 --> 01:40:51,620
...you don't have one. A home.

49
01:40:52,288 --> 01:40:53,872
It was taken from you.

01:40:56,959 --> 01:40:59,753
But I will help you take it back if I can.
