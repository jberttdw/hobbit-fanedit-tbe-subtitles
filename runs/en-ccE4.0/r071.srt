02:34:13,671 --> 02:34:15,298
BILBO:
What is this place?

2
02:34:15,548 --> 02:34:17,261
BALIN:
It was once the city of Dale.

3
02:34:18,843 --> 02:34:20,511
Now it is a ruin.

4
02:34:21,262 --> 02:34:23,473
The desolation of Smaug.

5
02:34:23,723 --> 02:34:25,642
The sun will soon reach midday.

6
02:34:25,892 --> 02:34:29,229
We must find the hidden door into
the mountain before it sets. This way.

7
02:34:29,479 --> 02:34:31,522
Wait. Is this the overlook?

8
02:34:31,856 --> 02:34:33,191
Gandalf said to meet him here.

9
02:34:33,441 --> 02:34:35,403
- On no account were we to--
- Do you see him?

10
02:34:35,735 --> 02:34:38,029
We have no time to wait upon the Wizard.

11
02:34:38,321 --> 02:34:40,073
We're on our own. Come!
