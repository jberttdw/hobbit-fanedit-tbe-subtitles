1
03:06:12,059 --> 03:06:13,894
We must look to our own.

2
03:06:14,478 --> 03:06:16,939
To the sick and the helpless.

3
03:06:17,564 --> 03:06:19,983
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.

4
03:06:20,234 --> 03:06:22,368
And those who have strength left, follow me.

5
03:06:22,569 --> 03:06:24,029
We must salvage what we can.

6
03:06:24,279 --> 03:06:26,076
And what then? What'll we do then?

7
03:06:30,536 --> 03:06:32,037
We find shelter.
