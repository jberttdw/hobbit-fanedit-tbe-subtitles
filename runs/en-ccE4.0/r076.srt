1
02:54:17,569 --> 02:54:20,572
I will not part with a single coin.

2
02:54:21,239 --> 02:54:23,783
Not one piece of it.

3
02:54:27,662 --> 02:54:29,956
My teeth are swords.

4
02:54:30,874 --> 02:54:34,169
My claws are spears.

5
02:54:36,296 --> 02:54:40,633
My wings are a hurricane!

6
02:54:46,264 --> 02:54:48,099
So it is true.

7
02:54:48,475 --> 02:54:50,602
The Black Arrow found its mark.

8
02:54:50,852 --> 02:54:52,015
What did you say?

9
02:54:52,604 --> 02:54:56,760
Uh--I--I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug the--

10
02:54:57,138 --> 02:54:58,228
...Tyrannical.

11
02:54:58,526 --> 02:54:59,611
Truly.

12
02:54:59,871 --> 02:55:02,614
You have no equal on this earth.

13
02:55:06,242 --> 02:55:10,413
I am almost tempted to let you take it.
